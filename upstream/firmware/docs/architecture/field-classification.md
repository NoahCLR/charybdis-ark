# Live-Profile Field Classification

This matrix classifies every user-relevant value represented by the three
authoring files. It is the scope boundary between live data, standard VIA
state, compiled ceilings, and executable firmware.

The first-grade product goal requires this to be a complete inventory. A missing field is not implicitly out of
scope: it must be added here and classified as live data, runtime-applicable
policy, bounded structure, compiled capability/safety, or executable/source-only
behavior. The UI must explain every intentional non-live boundary.

## `keymap.c`

| Surface | Classification | Initial stage | Runtime or validation owner |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| `key_behaviors[].keycode` | Milestone A behavior identity | 04 | profile behavior validator/provider |
| Row timing overrides | Milestone A behavior policy | 04 | profile behavior validator/provider |
| `keeps_auto_mouse_anchored` | Milestone A behavior policy | 04 | key runtime and auto-mouse bridge |
| Tap-count index and presence | Milestone A behavior policy | 04 | behavior validator/provider |
| Tap action | Milestone A behavior action | 04 | action-schema validator and key runtime |
| Hold/long-hold action | Milestone A behavior action | 04 | action-schema validator and key runtime |
| Hold mode and repeat rate | Milestone A behavior policy | 04 | behavior validator and lifecycle runtime |
| `keymaps[][]` | Standard VIA-owned state; C is compiled default | 06 | QMK dynamic keymap/VIA reconciliation |
| `VIA_MACROS` | Standard VIA-owned state; C is compiled default | 06 | QMK dynamic macro storage |
| Macro names | Portable settings domain `0x40` v4 onward, 64 names of up to 20 ASCII characters each; replaces the retired user macros (v2's 16 instruction streams and v3's shared 23-byte names are still read) | 06 | profile schema |
| Custom-key names | Portable settings domain `0x40` v5, 64 names of up to 20 ASCII characters each after the macro names; `CUSTOM_KEYS` in C is the compiled default | 06 | profile schema |
| `COMBOS` | GET `0x06` readout; optional live domain `0x30` for rows, timing and matching flags | 07 | combo validator/provider |
| Logical layer names/order | Eight-layer bank; portable names and reference-preserving order | 07 | whole-profile cross-reference validator |
| Userspace keycode blocks and the 64 custom-key slots | Executable firmware/action ABI; what a custom key does is its `key_behaviors[]` row | flash required | firmware build |

## `rgb_config.c`

Every row below is Milestone A data when its feature is compiled. A live
enable bit may disable a compiled stage, but live data cannot introduce a stage
that firmware did not compile.

| Surface | Semantic fields | Cache or lifecycle invalidation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Layer colors | layer id, HSV, render mode | rebuild derived layer colors/maps at frame boundary |
| Layer LED groups | selector, inherit/literal HSV, reusable group id | rebuild inactive RGB cache |
| Auto-mouse fade | mode, end HSV | rebuild inactive automouse cache |
| PD-mode colors | stable mode id, HSV, locality | rebuild inactive PD cache |
| PD-mode LED groups | selector, inherit/literal HSV, group id | rebuild inactive PD cache |
| Combo feedback | HSV, locality | rebuild inactive combo cache |
| Combo LED groups | inherit/literal HSV, group id | rebuild inactive combo cache |
| Tap-branch feedback colors | ordered HSV list | rebuild inactive key-feedback cache |
| Tap-committed/hold/long-hold colors | HSV values | rebuild inactive key-feedback cache |
| Tap-commit policy | enum | strict activation boundary because key planning reads it |
| Key-feedback locality | enum | RGB frame boundary |
| Key-feedback LED groups | semantic, inherit/literal HSV, group id | rebuild inactive key-feedback cache |
| Reusable LED groups | stable profile-local id and 58-bit bitmap | rebuild every referring stage cache |
| Stage enable states | one bit per compiled RGB stage | RGB frame boundary unless field affects key planning |

Source macro names and formatting are source-only metadata. The device stores
profile-local numeric group ids and LED bitmaps, not C preprocessor names.

## `config.h`

### Portable Live Policy

Complete profile export/import and the device-backed Defaults editors now carry
the following settings:

- `TAPPING_TERM`, `COMBO_TERM`, `CUSTOM_TAP_HOLD_TERM`,
  `CUSTOM_LONGER_HOLD_TERM`, and `CUSTOM_MULTI_TAP_TERM`;
- current normal and sniping DPI (the ladders remain compiled capabilities);
- pointing-mode DPI overrides;
- auto-sniping enable/layer;
- auto-mouse enable, layer, and timeout;
- default RGB effect, HSV value, and idle timeout;
- key-feedback flash period and auto-mouse RGB dead time.

The [portable settings contract](portable-profile-v1.md) supplies a bounded
runtime cache and QMK setters. It also includes debounce, activation delay,
movement threshold, combo enable/reference policy, RGB speed/flags, persistent
default-layer state and QMK keymap options. Combo timing is materialized in the
combo domain. The 64 VIA macros with their names and eight user-facing layer
names are portable.

### Compiled Capability Or Feature Inclusion

- `POINTING_DEVICE_AUTO_MOUSE_ENABLE`
- `RGB_PD_MODE_FEEDBACK_ENABLE`
- `RGB_COMBO_FEEDBACK_ENABLE`
- `RGB_KEY_BEHAVIOR_FEEDBACK_ENABLE`
- `RGB_AUTOMOUSE_GRADIENT_ENABLE`
- VIA, combo, RGB Matrix, pointing-device, and split feature gates

Milestone A adds runtime enable bits for compiled RGB feedback stages. Turning
on a feature omitted from the firmware still requires flashing.

### Compiled Capacity Ceiling

- `LAYER_COUNT` and `DYNAMIC_KEYMAP_LAYER_COUNT`
- `KEY_BEHAVIOR_MAX_TAP_COUNT`
- dynamic macro count
- RGB Matrix LED count and split geometry
- profile row, group, action, and payload limits

### Compiled Safety Or Resource Ceiling

- `RGB_MATRIX_MAXIMUM_BRIGHTNESS`
- `RGB_MATRIX_LED_FLUSH_LIMIT`
- wear-level backing size and EEPROM partition
- physical SRAM-bank, linked-section, allocator, stack, and regression-policy
  budgets
- repeat-rate maximum
- fixed action and schema compatibility rules

Safety ceilings can bound live values but cannot themselves be raised live.

### Source-Only Or Executable

- comments, source labels, whitespace and C macro names (user-facing layer
  names are portable settings);
- C helper implementations and QMK hooks;
- USB descriptors, VID/PID, Raw HID report size, and split transaction ids;
- hardware pins, drivers, sensor type, and matrix geometry.

These require source changes and a firmware build.

## Configurable PD Slots

The [PD-mode domain contract](pd-mode-domain-v1.md) covers configuration that
formerly lived partly outside the authored profile files. Schema 2 carries
eight stable PD identities. Retired settings scalars 10–14 are canonical zero;
per-slot records are the single owner of mode DPI.

| Surface | Classification | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Eight slot names, enabled state and engine selection | Bounded live structure | PD profile validator and effective slot provider |
| Directional outputs, thresholds and modifier filters | Live policy/actions within an advertised vocabulary | PD engine and action ownership |
| Scroll inversion, scaling, axis selection and timing | Live policy with validated numeric bounds | Repository-owned scroll engine |
| Mode-owned modifiers and mouse-button overrides | Bounded live policies | PD lifecycle and existing ownership APIs |
| Per-slot CPI and pointer-layer policy | Live policy; migrate existing DPI scalars to one owner | PD provider and compatibility layer |
| Eight RGB configurations and slot-targeted LED groups | Live data linked by stable slot ID | Existing RGB domain and renderer |
| Slot ceiling, engine implementations and output work limits | Compiled capacity/capability/safety | Firmware build and capability reporting |

## Canonical Identity Rules

- Standard QMK keycodes may use a 16-bit operand only when the stored
  action-ABI digest matches the connected firmware.
- Layer, PD-mode, VIA-macro, hardcoded-macro, and userspace-owned actions use
  semantic action kinds plus bounded operands. They are not persisted as raw
  custom-keycode enum values.
- PD identities come from the manifest's stable semantic id, not its current
  bit position.
- Layer references use logical layer ids validated against the candidate's
  complete layer set.
- Unknown action kinds, ids, reserved bits, or incompatible action-ABI digests
  reject the entire candidate.
