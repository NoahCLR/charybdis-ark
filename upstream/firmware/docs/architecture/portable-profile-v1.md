# Portable keyboard profile v1

> Current firmware accepts only the formats it writes (D-F10, D-F14): profile
> schema 3.0; RGB v4, key behaviors v2, combos v3, settings v6 and sparse PD v3;
> a 65,504-byte custom payload; and logical store format 4 (`NS`). Every save

> Older profile/store formats and the legacy GET 9 source page are rejected.
> Backup translation belongs to the client, before a current-format Apply.

A profile export is the effective configuration read from the keyboard. Flashed
and committed data have the same representation. An absent live domain is
materialized from device readback before export; it never means “use the
destination firmware's defaults”. Transient presses, running macros, pointer
motion and temporary layer activation are not configuration.

## Portable document

The UTF-8 JSON file has exactly these fields. Unknown fields and unsupported
versions fail validation. Files are limited to 100,000 bytes.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `format` | `charybdis-profile` |
| `version` | `1` |
| `keyboard` | `charybdis-4x6` |
| `actionAbiDigest` | Nonzero uint32 engine vocabulary identity |
| `layers` | Sixteen arrays of 60 uint16 native keycodes, in matrix row/column order, including unused physical matrix positions |
| `profile` | Canonical base64 NLP1 payload, at most 4,064 bytes; domains `0x10`, `0x20`, `0x30`, `0x40`, in that order |
| `macros` | Exactly 128 canonical base64 VIA macro streams, excluding their zero terminators |

The temporary bridge also exports five-layer documents. Import into the
standard image recognizes the deployed `0xdcb00959` action vocabulary, adds
three transparent layers, and translates native user triggers from `0x7e61`
upward by three positions. The eight-layer vocabulary is `0xeb80829c`; the
schema-2 pointing vocabulary `0x61072732`. Firmware with the userspace keycode
blocks uses `0x1d3fcacc`, and import into it translates a `0x61072732`
document key by key: pointing holds, locks and layer locks move to their
blocks, the keymap's own keys from `0x7e64` become custom keys 0, 1, 2… (a
behaviour target or combo output among them becomes action kind 7), and a key
holding a retired user macro is emptied. A retired user macro that a behaviour
or combo sends, or a user keycode with no counterpart, refuses the import.

Firmware with 32 pointing slots (D-F09) uses `0xf79c6151`: the same blocks,
now filled (`PD_SLOT_n` = `0x7e80 + n` and `PD_SLOT_n_LOCK` = `0x7ea0 + n` for
`n = 0..31`), with each mode flag digested at 32 bits. Import of a `0x1d3fcacc`
document into it is a key-by-key identity translation: every native keycode
and every action kind 4/5 operand `0..7` keeps its value. Its profile domains
change in two places. The PD domain goes from version 1 to version 2: drop
each disabled record without a name and write the header `02 20 60 nn 00 00
00 00`. The RGB domain goes from version 2 to version 3: set format byte 0 to
3 and header byte 7 to 32, and add after slot 7's PD colour row the rows
`n 00 00 00 02` (black, right half) for `n = 8..31`, as the 6 → 8 upgrade
added rows for slots 6 and 7. Every other byte is kept. The result grows by
120 − 96 × (dropped records) bytes and must still fit the 5,088-byte ceiling;
if it does not, the import is refused with that reason, never trimmed. A
`0x61072732` document translates to the blocks first, then the same way.
Other legacy vocabularies are rejected. Large legacy macro banks must fit the new
7,191-byte capacity, including 64 terminators and the final validity byte.

Firmware after D-F14 has a new action-ABI digest (it covers the layer, macro
and custom-key counts and the custom-key block). Import of a document from the
preceding eight-layer firmware translates key by key: every native keycode
keeps its value except a custom key, which moves from `0x7e40 + n` to
`0x7f00 + n` (its slot is kept); layers 8–15 are added as 60 `KC_TRNS` each;
and the 64 macro streams are followed by 64 empty ones. Action operands in the
profile keep their values. The NLP1 schema byte becomes 3 and each domain
moves one version: RGB 3 → 4 ([RGB domain](rgb-domain-v1.md)), key behaviours
1 → 2, combos 2 → 3 ([Profile Wire](profile-wire-v1.md)), settings 5 → 6
(below) and pointing 2 → 3 ([PD-mode domain](pd-mode-domain-v1.md)). The
result must fit the 65,504-byte ceiling. `tests/host/translate_eight_slot_profile.py`
is the firmware's executable reference for these domain steps; the firmware
itself never translates.

RGB and behaviour domains come from the effective committed domain or the
keyboard's compiled readback. Combo rows come from effective native readback;
the exported override is explicit even when empty. Custom trigger/release/
repress hooks, strict/disabled timing and fixed combo-reference builds are not
portable in v1 and prevent export. This standard board has no encoder or
user-selectable VIA layout options; EEPROM padding and validity metadata are
not profile content. Executable hooks, hardware geometry, engine inclusion and
safety ceilings remain firmware capabilities.

VIA streams support capability-gated canonical UTF-8 text (feature bit 21), tap/down/up instructions and decimal delay
instructions. Held keys must balance. The bank is reconstructed with zero
padding and a final zero validity byte. Both macro banks are independent:
64 VIA slots and 16 user macro slots retain their existing key identities.

See [Unicode macro playback](https://github.com/NoahCLR/charybdis-4x6/blob/3cdf5e2bfc681d45aff126a83f07b2e8cfdc1ffa/docs/architecture/runtime-flow.md) for encoding, compiled size, host setup and cancellation.

The reconstructed bank is the document's, not necessarily the keyboard's. A
valid bank may hold nonzero bytes after its 64th terminator, for instance after
a writer shortened the macros without clearing the rest; the document cannot
carry them and export stays canonical. Differential transfer therefore never
compares against a bank rebuilt from a document. A capture keeps the exact
layout and macro bytes it read, beside the storage identity it verified, and an
Apply compares staging and local roll-forward against those. Its result keeps
the target bank, which it has just proved both halves hold. A reviewed snapshot
without those bytes is not reused: Apply reads the keyboard again. The
interrupted-capture path already carries the raw bank it read.

## Settings domain `0x40`, version 6

Capability domain-mask bit 3 advertises this domain. An ordinary profile may
omit it; a complete portable file includes it. Firmware accepts only version
6, with the envelope version equal to the payload's first byte. Older settings
must be translated by the client before Apply; firmware never preserves or
executes retired user-macro instruction records.

All multibyte fields are little-endian:

| Offset | Bytes | Contents |
| ---: | ---: | --- |
| 0 | 8 | `[6, 16, 31, 128, 128, 0, 0, 0]`: version, layer count, scalar count, macro-name count, custom-key-name count, reserved zeros |
| 8 | 124 | 31 uint32 scalar values |
| 132 | 272 | 16 layer records of 17 bytes, layer 0 first: byte 0 the layer's combo reference layer (below 16); bytes 1–8 its behaviour-bypass placement bitmap; bytes 9–16 its combo-exclusion placement bitmap |
| 404 | variable | 272 counted names: 16 layer names, then 128 VIA macro names, then 128 custom-key names; each a uint8 length `0..32`, then that many bytes of UTF-8 |

The minimum is 676 bytes (every name empty) and the maximum 9,380 bytes (every
name 32 bytes). The complete profile shares the 65,504-byte ceiling and
rejects excess without trimming. Names are profile data for the client. Macro
content belongs to the bound VIA bank; custom keys execute their behavior rows.
Validation reads at most 20 settings bytes per step, in one read. Retired per-mode DPI
scalars 10–14 must be zero; mode tuning is in domain `0x50`.

Every name in this domain follows one rule: at most 32 encoded bytes of
well-formed UTF-8 (no overlong forms, no surrogates, nothing past U+10FFFF), no
C0 control character (`0x00`–`0x1f`) and no DEL (`0x7f`), and no multibyte
sequence cut by the length. Limits count bytes, not characters. Names are
counted, not NUL-terminated. Pointing-slot names in domain `0x50` keep their
own rule.

A placement bitmap's bit `n` (byte `n / 8`, bit `n % 8`) is matrix position
`n = row × MATRIX_COLS + column`. A bitmap holds up to 64 positions; this
keyboard has 60 (10 × 6), and bits at or past the advertised position count
(capability page 2, byte 9) must be zero. A set bypass bit sends the key at
that layer and position to its normal action instead of its shared behaviour;
a set exclusion bit keeps it out of combos. The
[participation policy](participation-policy.md) defines both.

| Scalar ID | Meaning |
| ---: | --- |
| 0–3 | Tapping, tap/hold, long-hold and multi-tap timing (ms) |
| 4–7 | Auto-mouse enabled, layer, timeout (ms), debounce (ms) |
| 8–9 | Auto-sniping enabled and layer |
| 10–14 | Retired per-mode DPI fields, must be zero |
| 15–16 | Key-feedback flash half-period and auto-mouse fade dead time (ms) |
| 17 | RGB idle timeout (ms); zero disables it |
| 18–19 | Actual normal and sniping DPI |
| 20 | Combos enabled |
| 21 | Four bytes: RGB enabled, effect, speed, flags |
| 22 | Three bytes: RGB hue, saturation, actual brightness; high byte zero |
| 23 | Persistent default-layer bitmask |
| 24 | QMK keymap options |
| 25–26 | Auto-mouse activation delay (ms) and movement threshold |
| 27 | Host settings: bits 0..1 select Auto (0), macOS (1), Windows (2), Linux (3); bit 8 enables Unicode playback; bits 16..23 name the [host layout](https://github.com/NoahCLR/charybdis-4x6/blob/3cdf5e2bfc681d45aff126a83f07b2e8cfdc1ffa/docs/architecture/host-layouts-v1.md) (0 US) and bit 24 marks a macOS ISO keyboard; other bits zero. Nonzero requires feature bit 21, and bits 16..24 feature bit 22. Previously reserved zero after version 5 combo references moved to layer records |
| 28 | Behaviour master enable |
| 29 | Layer behaviours mask, one bit per layer |
| 30 | Layer combos mask, one bit per layer |

Boolean values are 0/1. The auto-mouse layer (5) and auto-sniping layer (9)
are below 16. Timing/DPI policy scalars are uint16 except the RGB idle timeout
(maximum one day). Debounce is uint8. Flash half-period must be nonzero and
fade dead time less than auto-mouse timeout. Normal DPI is 400–3,400 in steps
of 200; sniping DPI is 100–400 in steps of 100. The default-layer mask (23) is
nonzero with bits only in 0–15. The layer masks (29, 30) reject bits 16 and
above; an empty mask is allowed.

Compiled defaults set scalar 28 to 1 and scalars 29 and 30 to `0xffff`; every
layer refers combos to itself, every bitmap is zero and layers 8–15 are
unnamed. So a profile that never sets the participation controls behaves as
version 5 did.

Version 5 translates in the client, never in firmware: scalars 0–26 are
copied; scalar 27's eight nibbles become the reference layers of layers 0–7
(layer `n` from bits `4n..4n+3`) and layers 8–15 refer to themselves; scalar
27 becomes 0, 28 becomes 1, and 29 and 30 become `0xffff`; bitmaps are zero;
layer names 0–7 are version 5's 24-byte fields up to their first zero byte and
8–15 are empty; the 64 macro names copy unchanged followed by 64 empty ones,
and the 64 custom-key names likewise, since version 5's printable-ASCII names
of at most 20 bytes are valid here.

At publication the settings invalidator copies the bounded domain into a cold
runtime cache using reads of at most 20 bytes. Key, RGB, pointer and macro
execution use the cache, without EEPROM reads. The settings module owns immutable factory scalars and authored names, also
included in the complete compiled profile. Compat injects the QMK apply hook;
the settings runtime has no reverse call into compat. Explicit stored settings
apply at the safe boundary. A missing settings domain warms the compiled
fallback cache without applying factory values to native owners.
Native RGB/DPI/default-layer/keymap settings retain their EEPROM ownership:
boot preserves newer native values, and export reads their current values.
Ordinary domain edits refresh these values before writing an existing settings
domain, and bind that read before and after acquiring the candidate lease.

## Readback commands

These use the existing Profile Wire custom GET envelope and request ID.

GET value `0x07` reads the effective settings domain with its scalars overlaid
by their live QMK owners. With no profile settings live it returns the current
version named by the keymap: `layer_names[]`, the name in each `VIA_MACROS`
row and in each `CUSTOM_KEYS` row. The request takes a 16-bit page, its low
byte at request byte 4 and its high byte at byte 5 (feature bit 19). Page 0's
12-byte payload is version `1`, chunk size `25`, uint16 length, CRC32, and
FNV-1a digest of the bytes as they are at that moment. Pages 1 onward return
successive 25-byte chunks with an exact short final chunk, streamed from the
live domain rather than a snapshot; the largest domain needs 376 chunk pages.
The host reads page 0 again after the chunks and requires identity and both
checksums to match, so a change during the read fails it. The complete export also
rechecks settings after reading the VIA banks, so changing RGB or DPI during a
backup invalidates the read.

GET value `0x08`, page 0 returns 25 bytes: version `1`; flags; local generation
and digest; peer generation and digest; last acknowledged generation; last
error; uint16 conflict count. Flags are local dirty (bit 0), recovery required
(1), digest valid (2), replication pending (3), and receiver active (4).
Readiness requires only the digest-valid flag, no reported error/conflict, and
matching local/peer generation and digest. These are VIA storage identities;
the custom-profile owner retains its separate status and generation.

GET value `0x08`, page 1 is optional editor metadata: exactly two bytes,
version `1` and the device's actual RGB maximum brightness (uint8, including
zero). The firmware reports `RGB_MATRIX_MAXIMUM_BRIGHTNESS`; it does not
change LED state. Earlier firmware rejects this page with status `2`. The app
treats only that canonical, correlated rejection as absent metadata; malformed
or other failed replies remain errors. Without the limit, the Defaults brightness
field is read-only. Other settings and existing export/import stay available.
With a reported limit, Defaults and full-profile restore reject an excessive
brightness before writing. This metadata is not configuration, is not exported,
and does not alter the portable profile fingerprint or payload schema.

GET value `0x08`, page 2 adds optional native editor capabilities. Its nine-byte
metadata payload is:

| Offset | Value |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Version `1` |
| 1 | Chunk size `25` |
| 2–3 | Body length, uint16 little-endian |
| 4 | Effect count; effect IDs are 1 through this count |
| 5 | Semantic key-option count, exactly `13` |
| 6–7 | Supported semantic key-option bitmask, uint16 little-endian |
| 8 | OR of this keyboard's LED classification flags |

Pages 3 onward return successive body chunks, with an exact short final chunk.
The body is 13 native uint16 little-endian key-option masks followed by one
64-byte, NUL-terminated, zero-padded ASCII effect token per effect. Names follow
`[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*`; names, masks and support flags come from the running firmware's
QMK build. The masks are distinct, nonzero single bits, derived from the native
keymap union rather than assuming its bitfield layout. Semantic option IDs are:

| ID | Key option |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Swap Control and Caps Lock |
| 1 | Caps Lock becomes Control |
| 2 | Swap left Alt and GUI |
| 3 | Swap right Alt and GUI |
| 4 | Disable GUI keys |
| 5 | Swap Grave and Escape |
| 6 | Swap Backslash and Backspace |
| 7 | NKRO |
| 8 | Swap left Control and GUI |
| 9 | Swap right Control and GUI |
| 10 | Enable one-shot keys |
| 11 | Swap Escape and Caps Lock |
| 12 | Autocorrect |

The host bounds total body length to pages 3–255 and rechecks page 2 after
reading. Only a canonical correlated status `2` with empty payload on page 2
means unavailable metadata. Unsupported bits, malformed names/masks, invalid
lengths, failed chunks and changed metadata are errors. Supported LED classes
are modifier (1), underglow (2), keylight (4) and indicator (8). The UI offers
their reported combinations, plus all (255) and none (0), and preserves a
current custom selection. Missing metadata makes effects, LED selection and
native key options read-only. Supported semantic bits gate editable key options.
Restore rejects an effect absent from the advertised inventory before staging.
This metadata is not exported and does not remap native effect IDs between
different firmware builds.

## Layer order and restoration

The standard image reserves sixteen layers, IDs 0–15. `LT()` and `LM()`
encode their layer in four bits, so every value they can express names a bank
layer; the five-bit layer actions (`MO`, `TG`, `TT`, `OSL`, `TO` and layer
locks) refuse layers 16 and above. Base stays at index zero. The app
shows highest priority first and rewrites references when overlays move:
matrix LT/LM/MO/TO/TG/DF/PDF/OSL/TT and userspace lock actions, behaviour targets
and branches, combo inputs/outputs/reference mapping, RGB rows/groups,
auto-mouse/auto-sniping targets, the persistent default-layer bitmask and the
layer behaviour and combo masks. Names and layer records (combo reference and
placement bitmaps) move with their layers. Save/discard other pending edits before reordering or
importing; stale layout drafts must not be applied to a new layer order.

Restore validates the file, captures a coherent current state, shows a review,
and saves a local recovery file before staging. After acquiring the profile
lease it compares the custom status, VIA generation/digest and settings digest
without transferring the complete matrix and macro bank again. The app sends
only changed VIA blocks to the non-USB half while that copy is inactive, then
firmware validates and durably prepares the custom record on both halves with
the exact target VIA generation and digest. The USB-side custom marker is the
logical decision. Firmware commits the peer custom record, accepts its staged
VIA copy, copies the target VIA state back to the USB half, and activates only
after both identities converge.

A timeout after the decision is reported as incomplete and retains the recovery
path. On reboot, a committed logical record fences normal VIA reconciliation
and effective-profile activation until its bound VIA generation is recovered.
Before the decision, an interrupted prepared record remains inactive and the
old USB-side VIA copy restores the peer. The detailed ordering is specified in
[`logical-profile-transaction-v1.md`](logical-profile-transaction-v1.md).
Physical power-loss acceptance at each durable boundary remains required.

## Upgrade and acceptance

Current firmware has sixteen-layer VIA geometry (a 1,920-byte keymap) and
synchronization metadata schema 4; an older bank is reset, not misread. Older geometry or action vocabulary is incompatible. The old bridge
is not built or served here: export with matching old firmware, then translate
the complete backup in the client before restoring through current logical
Apply. Firmware does not interpret old storage in place.

Host tests validate the app-generated populated payload using the compatibility
rules of firmware compiled with no behaviours or combos. Tests also cover
empty overrides, migration, reference rewrites, macro invalidation/retry,
review conflicts, recovery-file failures and readback mismatches. Browser
checks exercise naming, moving, saving and reviewing an import. The current side-specific pair is the supported build. The user reports that the new workflow appears to work
on their keyboard. Physical bridge/export/upgrade/import, restoration onto
firmware without authored behaviours or combos, reboot, power loss and USB-role
changes still require a recorded acceptance matrix. Ark's macro
builder now reads and edits both device banks through this complete-profile
restore path. Defaults controls use that path too. Physical acceptance remains
separate product work.

## Defaults editor

Ark's section controls receive effective scalar values from the
complete snapshot. Section saves preserve both macro banks, layer names and
all unedited profile bytes, use the complete-profile recovery/restore path, and
acknowledge only verified readback. Drafts are keyed by device and section and
retain their original complete-profile fingerprint. Failed saves and re-reads
keep drafts; external changes block stale saves until discard. Verified macro
and settings edits can advance unrelated drafts from their exact common base.

Dedicated controls cover all 28 settings, subject to advertised capabilities:
timing and pointer policies, all four bytes of lighting setting 21, HSV (22),
startup layers (23), supported native key options (24), and per-layer combo
references (27). Unedited bytes and unknown native bits remain intact. Startup
layers require a nonzero final mask; combo references use the reported names.

The firmware applies native lighting while temporarily enabled because QMK
ignores mode/HSV setters when disabled. At the existing safe activation boundary
it synchronously applies all lighting values, then restores and saves the final
enabled state. The renderer cannot run between these operations. This permits
editing saved colours/effects while lighting stays off and restoring a profile
whose lighting state differs from the current state.

## Shared editor draft

For a complete profile snapshot, the session owns a base fingerprint and a
validated target document. All editor messages stage through the existing pure
editors; layer moves and imports stage whole documents. Undo/redo retains up to
100 transitions. Messages carry both a unique draft instance ID and revision;
Apply additionally requires review of that exact revision and the original device.

The semantic review compares layout, names, actions, macros, RGB and settings.
Re-reading preserves a dirty target. If the saved fingerprint differs, editing
and Apply are blocked until the user explicitly reviews against the new read.
This rebases the complete target without merging conflicting external changes.
A failed/interrupted restore retains the target; an incomplete recovery read
uses its diagnostic fingerprint and clearly states that a full comparison is
unavailable.

Apply invokes one existing complete-profile restore, with recovery storage before
writes and target fingerprint verification before resetting history. Current
firmware publishes the custom and VIA stores as one logical generation. Export
still captures saved state. Drafts are window-local; unkept forms and kept
changes are not crash-persistent backups.
