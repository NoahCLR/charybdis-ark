A profile export is the effective configuration read from the keyboard. Flashed
and committed data have the same representation. An absent live domain is
materialized from device readback before export; it never means “use the
destination firmware's defaults”. Transient presses, running macros, pointer
motion and temporary layer activation are not configuration.

## Portable document

The UTF-8 JSON file has exactly these fields. Unknown fields and unsupported
versions fail validation. Files are limited to 100,000 bytes.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `format` | `charybdis-profile` |
| `version` | `1` |
| `keyboard` | `charybdis-4x6` |
| `actionAbiDigest` | Nonzero uint32 engine vocabulary identity |
| `layers` | Eight arrays of 60 uint16 native keycodes, in matrix row/column order, including unused physical matrix positions |
| `profile` | Canonical base64 NLP1 payload, at most 4,064 bytes; domains `0x10`, `0x20`, `0x30`, `0x40`, in that order |
| `macros` | Exactly 64 canonical base64 VIA macro streams, excluding their zero terminators |

The temporary bridge also exports five-layer documents. Import into the
standard image recognizes the deployed `0xdcb00959` action vocabulary, adds
three transparent layers, and translates native user triggers from `0x7e61`
upward by three positions. The eight-layer vocabulary is `0xeb80829c`; the
schema-2 pointing vocabulary `0x61072732`. Firmware with the userspace keycode
blocks uses `0x1d3fcacc`, and import into it translates a `0x61072732`
document key by key: pointing holds, locks and layer locks move to their
blocks, the keymap's own keys from `0x7e64` become custom keys 0, 1, 2… (a
behaviour target or combo output among them becomes action kind 7), and a key
holding a retired user macro is emptied. A retired user macro that a behaviour
or combo sends, or a user keycode with no counterpart, refuses the import.
Other legacy vocabularies are rejected. Large legacy macro banks must fit the new
7,191-byte capacity, including 64 terminators and the final validity byte.

RGB and behaviour domains come from the effective committed domain or the
keyboard's compiled readback. Combo rows come from effective native readback;
the exported override is explicit even when empty. Custom trigger/release/
repress hooks, strict/disabled timing and fixed combo-reference builds are not
portable in v1 and prevent export. This standard board has no encoder or
user-selectable VIA layout options; EEPROM padding and validity metadata are
not profile content. Executable hooks, hardware geometry, engine inclusion and
safety ceilings remain firmware capabilities.

VIA streams support ASCII text, tap/down/up instructions and decimal delay
instructions. Held keys must balance. The bank is reconstructed with zero
padding and a final zero validity byte. Both macro banks are independent:
64 VIA slots and 16 user macro slots retain their existing key identities.

The reconstructed bank is the document's, not necessarily the keyboard's. A
valid bank may hold nonzero bytes after its 64th terminator, for instance after
a writer shortened the macros without clearing the rest; the document cannot
carry them and export stays canonical. Differential transfer therefore never
compares against a bank rebuilt from a document. A capture keeps the exact
layout and macro bytes it read, beside the storage identity it verified, and an
Apply compares staging and local roll-forward against those. Its result keeps
the target bank, which it has just proved both halves hold. A reviewed snapshot
without those bytes is not reused: Apply reads the keyboard again. The
interrupted-capture path already carries the raw bank it read.

## Settings domain `0x40`, version 1

Capability domain-mask bit 3 advertises this domain and the full readback
commands below. The portable image includes the pointing, combo and RGB engines.
An ordinary profile may omit the domain; a complete portable file must include
it. An explicit empty macro slot overrides its flashed default.

All multibyte fields below are little-endian:

| Offset | Bytes | Contents |
| ---: | ---: | --- |
| 0 | 8 | `[1, 8, 28, 16, 0, 0, 0, 0]`: version, name count, scalar count, macro count, reserved zeros |
| 8 | 112 | 28 uint32 scalar values |
| 120 | 192 | Eight UTF-8 names, each 24 bytes: at most 23 bytes of text, then a zero and zero padding |
| 312 | variable | Sixteen records: uint16 instruction length followed by instruction bytes |

The minimum domain size is 344 bytes; the maximum is 1,368. Each user macro
has at most 512 instruction bytes and their combined content at most 1,024.
Instructions are `1` + uint8 text length + ASCII bytes, `2` + uint16 delay,
`3` + uint8 key down, `4` + uint8 key up, or `5` + uint8 key count + simultaneous
tap keys. Key lists and concurrently held sets are bounded to 16 and must not
duplicate keys or leave them pressed. Controls and malformed UTF-8 are rejected
in names. Firmware validation reads at most one byte per settings step.

### Version 3: VIA macro names instead of user macros

Schema-2 firmware from 2026-09-23 writes settings version 3 and still reads
version 2, so a keyboard's stored profile survives the update. The 16 user
macros are retired; version 3 names the 64 VIA macros in their place:

| Offset | Bytes | Contents |
| ---: | ---: | --- |
| 0 | 8 | `[3, 8, 28, 64, 0, 0, 0, 0]`: version, layer-name count, scalar count, macro-name count, reserved zeros |
| 8 | 112 | 28 uint32 scalar values, as in version 2 |
| 120 | 192 | Eight layer names, as in version 2 |
| 312 | variable | 64 records: uint8 length (0–23), then that many bytes of UTF-8 |

The ceiling stays 1,368 bytes, so the 64 names share 992 bytes of text: each
can be 23 bytes, but not all of them at once. Names contain no NUL, C0
controls, DEL, overlong or surrogate encodings. The envelope version and the
payload's first byte must agree. The minimum is 376 bytes, all names empty.

The firmware never reads a name; they are profile data for the app, saved and
copied to the other half with everything else. The firmware no longer plays
user macros at all: a version-2 domain's macro records are kept and read back
as stored, but never run. Their keycodes are gone: `0x7e40..0x7e4f` are now
custom keys 0–15 (version 5). The app upgrades a profile to version 3 only when a macro is named; any other
edit keeps the version it read, and a schema-1 profile cannot carry names.

### Version 4: every macro name gets 20 characters

Version 3's names share 992 bytes, so a name's real limit depended on the
others. Version 4 keeps version 3's layout and makes the limit fixed: each of
the 64 names is 0–20 bytes of printable ASCII (`0x20`–`0x7e`), and the ceiling
rises to 1,656 bytes (312 + 64 × 21), so all 64 can be full length at once.
Accents and emoji are not accepted; a guarantee for them would cost up to four
bytes a character. Each version keeps its own ceiling: firmware refuses a
version-3 domain over 1,368 bytes, since that ceiling is what bounds version 3's
names.

Firmware from 2026-09-23 writes version 4 and still reads versions 2 and 3. The accepted set is defined once, as `NOAH_PROFILE_PD_SETTINGS_VERSION_ACCEPTED`, for both the validator and the store's shape check.
The app upgrades to version 4 when a macro is named. A stored version-3 name
keeps its printable ASCII characters, trimmed and cut to 20, and review shows
any name that changed. The effective settings cache grows to 1,656 bytes, 288
bytes more static RAM per half; see
[memory budgets](memory-budgets.md#retired-user-macros-and-streamed-settings-readback--2026-09-23).

### Version 5: custom-key names

The 64 custom keys (`CUSTOM_KEY_n`, action kind 7) are named here, the way the
macros are: version 5 keeps version 4's layout and follows the 64 macro-name
records with 64 custom-key name records in the same form, 0–20 bytes of
printable ASCII each. Header byte 4, zero before, counts them (`64`). The
ceiling is 3,000 bytes (312 + 128 × 21), so every name fits the domain at full
length. The whole profile still shares the 5,088-byte ceiling: a profile with 37
behaviours, 10 combos and eight pointing slots leaves room for about 120
full-length names, and a name edit that meets the ceiling is refused as "the
profile is full" rather than shortened. A custom key does only what its behaviour row says; its name is profile
data for the app, which the firmware never reads.

Firmware with the userspace keycode blocks (Profile Wire feature bit 16)
writes version 5 and still reads versions 2–4. The app upgrades to version 5
only when a custom key is named; a macro name alone still upgrades to 4. The
effective settings cache grows to 3,000 bytes, 1,344 bytes more static RAM per
half.

| Scalar ID | Meaning |
| ---: | --- |
| 0–3 | Tapping, tap/hold, long-hold and multi-tap timing (ms) |
| 4–7 | Auto-mouse enabled, layer, timeout (ms), debounce (ms) |
| 8–9 | Auto-sniping enabled and layer |
| 10–14 | Dragscroll, volume, brightness, zoom and arrow-mode DPI |
| 15–16 | Key-feedback flash half-period and auto-mouse fade dead time (ms) |
| 17 | RGB idle timeout (ms); zero disables it |
| 18–19 | Actual normal and sniping DPI |
| 20 | Combos enabled |
| 21 | Four bytes: RGB enabled, effect, speed, flags |
| 22 | Three bytes: RGB hue, saturation, actual brightness; high byte zero |
| 23 | Persistent default-layer bitmask |
| 24 | QMK keymap options |
| 25–26 | Auto-mouse activation delay (ms) and movement threshold |
| 27 | Eight four-bit combo reference-layer IDs, lowest layer first |

Boolean values are 0/1; layer IDs must fit the bank. Timing/DPI policy scalars
are uint16 except the RGB idle timeout (maximum one day). Debounce is uint8.
Flash half-period must be nonzero and fade dead time less than auto-mouse
timeout. Normal DPI is 400–3,400 in steps of 200; sniping DPI is 100–400 in steps
of 100. The default-layer mask is nonzero and contains no out-of-bank bits.

At publication the settings invalidator copies the bounded domain into a cold
runtime cache using reads of at most 20 bytes. Key, RGB, pointer and macro
execution use the cache, without EEPROM reads. The invalidator refreshes macro
validation metadata and applies QMK-owned settings at the safe boundary.
Native RGB/DPI/default-layer/keymap settings retain their EEPROM ownership:
boot preserves newer native values, and export reads their current values.
Ordinary domain edits refresh these values before writing an existing settings
domain, and bind that read before and after acquiring the candidate lease.

## Readback commands

These use the existing Profile Wire custom GET envelope and request ID.

GET value `0x07` reads the effective settings domain with its scalars overlaid
by their live QMK owners. With no profile settings live it returns the current
version named by the keymap: `layer_names[]`, the name in each `VIA_MACROS`
row and, in version 5, in each `CUSTOM_KEYS` row. Page 0's 12-byte payload is version `1`,
chunk size `25`, uint16 length, CRC32, and FNV-1a digest of the bytes as they
are at that moment. Pages 1 onward return successive 25-byte chunks with an
exact short final chunk, streamed from the live domain rather than a snapshot.
The host reads page 0 again after the chunks and requires identity and both
checksums to match, so a change during the read fails it. The complete export also
rechecks settings after reading the VIA banks, so changing RGB or DPI during a
backup invalidates the read.

GET value `0x08`, page 0 returns 25 bytes: version `1`; flags; local generation
and digest; peer generation and digest; last acknowledged generation; last
error; uint16 conflict count. Flags are local dirty (bit 0), recovery required
(1), digest valid (2), replication pending (3), and receiver active (4).
Readiness requires only the digest-valid flag, no reported error/conflict, and
matching local/peer generation and digest. These are VIA storage identities;
the custom-profile owner retains its separate status and generation.

GET value `0x08`, page 1 is optional editor metadata: exactly two bytes,
version `1` and the device's actual RGB maximum brightness (uint8, including
zero). The firmware reports `RGB_MATRIX_MAXIMUM_BRIGHTNESS`; it does not
change LED state. Earlier firmware rejects this page with status `2`. The app
treats only that canonical, correlated rejection as absent metadata; malformed
or other failed replies remain errors. Without the limit, the Defaults brightness
field is read-only. Other settings and existing export/import stay available.
With a reported limit, Defaults and full-profile restore reject an excessive
brightness before writing. This metadata is not configuration, is not exported,
and does not alter the portable profile fingerprint or payload schema.

GET value `0x08`, page 2 adds optional native editor capabilities. Its nine-byte
metadata payload is:

| Offset | Value |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Version `1` |
| 1 | Chunk size `25` |
| 2–3 | Body length, uint16 little-endian |
| 4 | Effect count; effect IDs are 1 through this count |
| 5 | Semantic key-option count, exactly `13` |
| 6–7 | Supported semantic key-option bitmask, uint16 little-endian |
| 8 | OR of this keyboard's LED classification flags |

Pages 3 onward return successive body chunks, with an exact short final chunk.
The body is 13 native uint16 little-endian key-option masks followed by one
64-byte, NUL-terminated, zero-padded ASCII effect token per effect. Names follow
`[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*`; names, masks and support flags come from the running firmware's
QMK build. The masks are distinct, nonzero single bits, derived from the native
keymap union rather than assuming its bitfield layout. Semantic option IDs are:

| ID | Key option |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Swap Control and Caps Lock |
| 1 | Caps Lock becomes Control |
| 2 | Swap left Alt and GUI |
| 3 | Swap right Alt and GUI |
| 4 | Disable GUI keys |
| 5 | Swap Grave and Escape |
| 6 | Swap Backslash and Backspace |
| 7 | NKRO |
| 8 | Swap left Control and GUI |
| 9 | Swap right Control and GUI |
| 10 | Enable one-shot keys |
| 11 | Swap Escape and Caps Lock |
| 12 | Autocorrect |

The host bounds total body length to pages 3–255 and rechecks page 2 after
reading. Only a canonical correlated status `2` with empty payload on page 2
means unavailable metadata. Unsupported bits, malformed names/masks, invalid
lengths, failed chunks and changed metadata are errors. Supported LED classes
are modifier (1), underglow (2), keylight (4) and indicator (8). The UI offers
their reported combinations, plus all (255) and none (0), and preserves a
current custom selection. Missing metadata makes effects, LED selection and
native key options read-only. Supported semantic bits gate editable key options.
Restore rejects an effect absent from the advertised inventory before staging.
This metadata is not exported and does not remap native effect IDs between
different firmware builds.

## Layer order and restoration

The standard image reserves eight layers. Base stays at index zero. The app
shows highest priority first and rewrites references when overlays move:
matrix LT/LM/MO/TO/TG/DF/PDF/OSL/TT and userspace lock actions, behaviour targets
and branches, combo inputs/outputs/reference mapping, RGB rows/groups,
auto-mouse/auto-sniping targets and the persistent default-layer bitmask. Names
move with their layers. Save/discard other pending edits before reordering or
importing; stale layout drafts must not be applied to a new layer order.

Restore validates the file, captures a coherent current state, shows a review,
and saves a local recovery file before staging. After acquiring the profile
lease it compares the custom status, VIA generation/digest and settings digest
without transferring the complete matrix and macro bank again. The app sends
only changed VIA blocks to the non-USB half while that copy is inactive, then
firmware validates and durably prepares the custom record on both halves with
the exact target VIA generation and digest. The USB-side custom marker is the
logical decision. Firmware commits the peer custom record, accepts its staged
VIA copy, copies the target VIA state back to the USB half, and activates only
after both identities converge.

A timeout after the decision is reported as incomplete and retains the recovery
path. On reboot, a committed logical record fences normal VIA reconciliation
and effective-profile activation until its bound VIA generation is recovered.
Before the decision, an interrupted prepared record remains inactive and the
old USB-side VIA copy restores the peer. The detailed ordering is specified in
[`logical-profile-transaction-v1.md`](logical-profile-transaction-v1.md).
Physical power-loss acceptance at each durable boundary remains required.

## Upgrade and acceptance

The bridge retains five-layer VIA geometry and schema-1 reconciliation metadata,
and the exact deployed compiled-profile digest/action identity. Recognized VIA
storage survives the firmware build-date change; dirty metadata remains dirty
for recovery. The eight-layer image uses metadata schema 2 and deliberately
resets incompatible five-layer geometry. Export on the bridge **before** flashing
the eight-layer pair, then import the resulting file. The app does not flash.

Host tests validate the app-generated populated payload using the compatibility
rules of firmware compiled with no behaviours or combos. Tests also cover
empty overrides, migration, reference rewrites, macro invalidation/retry,
review conflicts, recovery-file failures and readback mismatches. Browser
checks exercise naming, moving, saving and reviewing an import. Both standard
and bridge pairs build. The user reports that the new workflow appears to work
on their keyboard. Physical bridge/export/upgrade/import, restoration onto
firmware without authored behaviours or combos, reboot, power loss and USB-role
changes still require a recorded acceptance matrix. The live app macro
builder now reads and edits both device banks through this complete-profile
restore path. Defaults controls use that path too. Physical acceptance remains
separate product work.


## Defaults editor

The live app's section controls receive effective scalar values from the
complete snapshot. Section saves preserve both macro banks, layer names and
all unedited profile bytes, use the complete-profile recovery/restore path, and
acknowledge only verified readback. Drafts are keyed by device and section and
retain their original complete-profile fingerprint. Failed saves and re-reads
keep drafts; external changes block stale saves until discard. Verified macro
and settings edits can advance unrelated drafts from their exact common base.

Dedicated controls cover all 28 settings, subject to advertised capabilities:
timing and pointer policies, all four bytes of lighting setting 21, HSV (22),
startup layers (23), supported native key options (24), and per-layer combo
references (27). Unedited bytes and unknown native bits remain intact. Startup
layers require a nonzero final mask; combo references use the reported names.

The firmware applies native lighting while temporarily enabled because QMK
ignores mode/HSV setters when disabled. At the existing safe activation boundary
it synchronously applies all lighting values, then restores and saves the final
enabled state. The renderer cannot run between these operations. This permits
editing saved colours/effects while lighting stays off and restoring a profile
whose lighting state differs from the current state.


## Shared editor draft

For a complete eight-layer snapshot, the session owns a base fingerprint and a
validated target document. All editor messages stage through the existing pure
editors; layer moves and imports stage whole documents. Undo/redo retains up to
100 transitions. Messages carry both a unique draft instance ID and revision;
Apply additionally requires review of that exact revision and the original device.

The semantic review compares layout, names, actions, macros, RGB and settings.
Re-reading preserves a dirty target. If the saved fingerprint differs, editing
and Apply are blocked until the user explicitly reviews against the new read.
This rebases the complete target without merging conflicting external changes.
A failed/interrupted restore retains the target; an incomplete recovery read
uses its diagnostic fingerprint and clearly states that a full comparison is
unavailable.

Apply invokes one existing complete-profile restore, with recovery storage before
writes and target fingerprint verification before resetting history. Current
firmware publishes the custom and VIA stores as one logical generation. Export
still captures saved state. Drafts are window-local; unkept forms and kept
changes are not crash-persistent backups.
