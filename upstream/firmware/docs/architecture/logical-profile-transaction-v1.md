# Logical Profile Transaction V1

> Current firmware accepts only the formats it writes (D-F10): profile schema
> 2.0; RGB v3, key behaviors v1, combos v2, settings v5 and sparse PD v2;
> a 5,088-byte custom payload; and logical store format 3 (`NR`). Every save
> binds a nonzero VIA generation and digest. HID and split framing remain v1.
> Older profile/store formats and the legacy GET 9 source page are rejected.
> Backup translation belongs to the client, before a current-format Apply.

## Purpose

One Apply must publish one logical profile generation containing the custom
Profile Wire payload, VIA keymap, and VIA macro bank. A reset or loss of power
may leave recovery work, but normal key output must observe either the complete
old generation or the complete new generation. It must never observe a mixture.

This contract replaces the current recovery-file-only boundary between the
dual-slot custom store and the in-place VIA store. It retains standard VIA
storage and does not add a second 8 KiB EEPROM cache.

## Identity

The logical manifest contains the logical generation; custom profile generation,
origin, payload length, CRC32, and FNV-1a digest; VIA generation and canonical
VIA digest; action ABI digest; and storage schema.

The custom slot header advances to a format that carries the bound VIA identity
and two marker states: `prepared` and `committed`. The prepared marker is durable
transaction intent but is never active authority. The committed marker is the
logical decision record. Format-1 `NP` and format-2 `NQ` records are rejected
at boot and admission; firmware does not migrate old storage.

Format 3 keeps a 32-byte header and 5,088-byte payload capacity. Its `NR`
magic binds schema 2.0. Byte 2 packs five domain bits (0–4), origin (5),
profile flags (6), and a reserved zero bit (7). The header retains payload
CRC32, compiled-default digest and action-ABI digest, and stores the bound VIA
generation and digest. Validation derives the canonical payload digest again.
CRC16 protects bytes 0–28; byte 31 is the one-byte prepared/committed marker. This preserves
firmware-update compatibility checks instead of treating the current firmware's
identities as if they had been stored with the profile.

The effective-profile owner may publish a committed custom record only while
the local VIA identity matches the record's bound VIA identity. A mismatch is a
recovery state and blocks normal output until reconciliation completes. The VIA
layer enforces this after a restart: output stays fenced while boot recovery
has not yet matched the local bank to the committed record's bound identity
(normally a fraction of a second, until the local digest completes), and while
a bank that booted dirty from an interrupted write has not been made clean
again. Both clear only from a complete generation, which may need the peer.
Uninitialized metadata on a freshly flashed half, an ordinary VIA edit in
progress, and owner error states do not fence output.

## Why The Peer Is The VIA Staging Copy

The 18 KiB logical EEPROM is fully partitioned. Adding an 8 KiB inactive VIA
bank by doubling the RP2040 wear-level backing would also add a 16 KiB RAM cache
on every half. The physical SRAM can hold that increase, but the current linked
`.data + .bss` regression policy cannot, and no runtime allocator high-water
evidence justifies changing that policy yet.

The split already has two durable VIA copies. During a transaction the non-USB
half becomes the inactive VIA staging copy while the USB half continues serving
the old generation. This uses existing physical storage and makes the ordering
explicit instead of allowing ordinary write-through commands to expose a
partially replaced bank.

## Commit Sequence

1. The host captures the complete old profile and saves its recovery file.
2. Firmware acquires the custom candidate lease on the USB half.
3. The host streams target VIA regions through the logical staging channel.
   The USB half admits them only for the live candidate's transaction and
   bound VIA identity, before COMMIT, and relays them to the peer only;
   ordinary VIA write-through and reconciliation are fenced for this
   transaction. See Cancellation And Lease Ownership.
4. The peer computes the canonical VIA digest. A mismatch aborts before durable
   transaction intent exists, and the old USB-side VIA copy restores the peer.
5. The custom candidate is validated and prepared on both halves with the exact
   target VIA identity. Both prepared markers become durable.
6. The USB half writes its custom commit marker. This is the logical decision
   point. The owner first waits for a safe behavior boundary, reporting the
   wait as peer-status flag bit 2, so a held key or locked layer can still end
   the Apply cleanly on the pre-decision timeout. The USB half keeps typing
   the complete old generation through the decision: its VIA bank and active
   custom profile are both still old. Runtime activation remains blocked
   because its VIA store is still old.
7. The peer commits the same custom record, accepts its staged VIA generation,
   and becomes the complete new replica. The owner requests that VIA ACCEPT
   only at a safe behavior boundary (flag bit 2 again while it waits) and
   fences key output from the request until activation: from ACCEPT the USB
   half's VIA bytes, custom behaviors, or both may belong to different
   generations. Entering the fence at a safe boundary matters because
   activation needs the same boundary and fenced keys could not release a
   hold or unlock a layer. A press made during the fence also loses its
   release. Boot, discovery and owner error states keep typing on the loaded
   keymap, except while a restart left the local VIA bank suspect (see
   Identity).
8. After the decision is observable, the host waits for the peer VIA accept and
   writes only the changed VIA ranges to the USB half. A custom-only change uses
   one verified no-op keycode write to advance the bound VIA generation. The
   peer remains the complete recovery copy throughout this roll-forward.
   Ordinary split VIA mirroring is suppressed during staging and roll-forward,
   including mirror frames queued before staging began. A pause between local
   VIA write chunks cannot publish an intermediate digest or consume the target
   VIA generation. If no local VIA write arrives for
   `VIA_SPLIT_SYNC_LOGICAL_ROLL_FORWARD_IDLE_MS` (15 s) after ACCEPT or the
   last write, the USB half releases the hold itself, exactly as a reboot
   would. Its partly written bank stays dirty, or stays at the old generation
   if nothing was written, so ordinary reconciliation pulls the peer's complete
   accepted copy over it. The discarded partial mutation is covered by that
   pull. A late host write carries the same target bytes, so it only restarts
   the pull, which then converges.
9. The effective-profile owner activates at the existing safe behavior boundary
   once the peer has confirmed the new generation and this half holds it
   completely. The peer's confirmation is its durable custom commit, observed
   by the USB half, and its acknowledged VIA ACCEPT; ACCEPT is sent only while
   the peer is in sight. This half's part is its VIA bank clean at the target
   generation and digest. The peer is not observed a second time, so a link
   lost during roll-forward cannot hold activation; nothing activates on one
   half before the other has confirmed it. Ordinary reconciliation compares
   both halves again when the link returns, and a conflict there still ends
   in the existing conflict states.

## Power-Loss Outcomes

| Last durable point | Recovery authority | Visible profile |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Before both prepared markers | old USB-side committed manifest and VIA copy | old |
| Both prepared, before USB commit marker | old manifest; prepared work may be discarded | old |
| USB commit marker durable | new manifest; peer staging copy supplies target VIA bytes | output blocked until new is complete |
| Both custom markers durable, USB VIA incomplete | new peer replica | output blocked until new is complete |
| Both logical identities converged | new manifest | new |

An acknowledgement loss is resolved from markers and identities. A missing peer
before the decision is a safe abort. A missing peer after the decision is an
explicit recovery state because the only complete target VIA copy may be there.
It resumes by itself when the link returns, with no restart: before ACCEPT
the USB half keeps typing the old generation meanwhile. After the peer's
acknowledged ACCEPT, the host finishes rewriting the USB half and it activates
without the link (step 9). Output stays fenced across a lost link only when
ACCEPT is requested in the instant before the USB half notices the link is
gone (its acknowledgement then waits for the peer), or when the host also
disappears mid-rewrite: no complete generation exists on the USB half, and
the firmware roll-forward needs the peer's copy. Unplugging the link cable also powers the
peer off. A peer that rebooted keeps its durable prepared custom record and
staged VIA bank but not its volatile leases, so the USB half sends the custom
copy again from its own committed record (logical copies rebind first) before
the authorized commit, and the peer's ACCEPT matches the staged bank by its
persisted generation and recomputed digest.

## Cancellation And Lease Ownership

The VIA staging belongs to the custom candidate it is bound to, and only the
profile owner ends it: ACCEPT after the decision, a cancel before it. The host
has no abort of its own. A host whose status read failed after the marker
became durable cannot tell a decided save from an undecided one, and a host
abort admitted then would discard the peer's staged copy, the only complete
target, while the custom transaction refused its own cancel.

The logical staging channel (custom set `0x07`, channel `0x00`) takes these
host values:

| Value | Host operation | Admitted when |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| `0x15` | BEGIN staging | the candidate with this transaction id binds this VIA generation and digest, and is receiving, complete, validating or validated with no COMMIT or ABORT queued; no other staging is live |
| `0x16` | CHUNK | as BEGIN, and the staging is still STAGING: VERIFY fixes the staged bytes |
| `0x17` | VERIFY | as BEGIN |
| `0x19` | status (custom get) | always |
| `0x1A` | ABORT | never: answered admission `3` (unsupported), error invalid state |

A frame for any other transaction or identity, or after COMMIT, is answered
admission `3` with error wrong transaction and never reaches the VIA layer, so
a staging cannot outlive its candidate or change after the decision. Busy
(admission `2`) means the VIA layer still has a frame queued, or a cancelled
staging's peer ABORT is still waiting for the link; the host retries.

Every cancel before the decision ends both stores: the host's candidate abort,
the 15-second lease, peer supersession, a failed copy to the peer, and a
storage failure all take the owner's one cancel path. The VIA cancel is
idempotent. It queues the peer ABORT, replacing a queued BEGIN, CHUNK or VERIFY
whose outcome it covers; it succeeds when that ABORT is already queued or when
nothing of that identity is staged, so a candidate that never reached staging
is released just the same; and it refuses only an identity already accepted
or accepting. A peer that answers the ABORT holding no such staging (it
restarted, or BEGIN never reached it) completes the abort as well. The owner
requests it once per cancel, so a repeated host abort or a lost acknowledgement
changes nothing.

Cancel is bounded without the peer. The custom candidate is released at once;
this half's VIA bank was never written, so the old generation stays complete
here. The peer ABORT stays queued, holding reconciliation and refusing a new
BEGIN, until the link returns; then it completes, the peer's partly staged
bank is dirty, and ordinary reconciliation copies this half's bank back.

A staging frame the owner admitted and the VIA layer queued is the candidate's
progress: the next owner scan counts it as host activity, so a staging longer
than the 15-second lease keeps its candidate. Status polls on either channel
are not progress, so abandoned staging still expires with its candidate. From
COMMITTING on nothing expires or cancels.

## External VIA Writers

Ordinary VIA writes remain supported outside a logical transaction. Firmware
first converges VIA storage on both halves, then adopts its new VIA identity as
a new logical manifest generation bound to the unchanged custom digest. Until
adoption finishes, the live client reports an external-change transition and refuses a
stale Apply.

## Performance Contract

The host reads a complete snapshot once for review and recovery. After acquiring
the candidate lease, it checks custom identity, VIA identity, and settings digest
without rereading the 7,191-byte macro bank. It transfers only changed 28-byte
VIA blocks. Success uses exact changed-block readback plus stable custom and VIA
identities on both halves; Refresh and Export remain independent full reads.

The logical staging channel carries 12 data bytes per report because every chunk
also carries transaction, region, generation and digest correlation. Apply keeps
the differential range selection, so ordinary edits still avoid transferring the
unchanged macro capacity. Firmware holds ordinary full-store reconciliation after
the decision while the connected host performs this differential roll-forward.
If the host disappears, the firmware roll-forward (step 8) or a reboot clears
that volatile hold, and reconciliation copies the peer's complete target.

## Implementation Status

The storage format, candidate binding, peer VIA staging channel, two-half durable
prepare, USB-side decision marker, peer commit, VIA roll-forward, activation
gate, boot recovery fence, and app coordinator are implemented. Host tests cover
prepared-marker reboot selection, incompatible firmware identities, predecision
abort, decision ordering, role recovery, bound-record split transfer, staged VIA
acceptance, reboot recovery, and the firmware roll-forward after the host goes
quiet mid-write, never writes, or writes late during the pull; a lost peer link
after the decision, with and without the peer rebooting, resuming on reconnect;
ACCEPT waiting for a safe boundary while input still works; ACCEPT never sent
to a peer known to be unreachable; and activation with the link lost during
roll-forward. Cancellation ownership is covered by the owner, VIA-sync and
channel tests and by `run_profile_owner_via_integration_tests.sh`, which runs
the real owner, staging handler and VIA split sync together: an unobserved
decision rolling forward despite host aborts, a pre-decision cancel ending both
stores once, an abandoned staging expiring with its candidate, staging progress
renewing the lease while polls do not, and cleanup waiting for an absent peer. The firmware advertises atomic logical Apply as
a required write capability, so the app refuses complete Apply on older images.

Physical interruption tests at every durable boundary and external VIA-writer
adoption remain acceptance work. The recovery file remains part of Apply while
that hardware matrix is incomplete.
