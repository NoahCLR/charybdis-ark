# Device-Resident Profile Target

This document defines the ownership model for live editing with Charybdis Live
([`tools/charybdis-live/`](../../../../README.md)). It supersedes the earlier project assumption that the three C
authoring files must remain the only source of truth during a live editing
session.

This is the technical profile contract beneath the broader
[`Product Goal`](../../../../docs/PRODUCT_GOAL.md).
The product target is first-grade keyboard control software, not only a working
live-edit protocol.

## Goal

The keyboard owns one readable, versioned, committed logical profile containing
the editable values represented by:

- `config.h` profile policy;
- `keymap.c` layers, behaviors, combos, and macros;
- `rgb_config.c` colors, feedback policy, and LED groups.

The live app connects to the keyboard, reads that logical profile, edits a
local draft based on its exact generation, commits a replacement safely to both
halves, and reads it back for verification. Reflashing is required only when
executable firmware capabilities change.

The keyboard does not store literal C source. Comments, formatting, preprocessor
expressions, and executable code are compiler inputs and cannot be reconstructed
losslessly from firmware data. It stores the complete structured values needed
to reproduce the supported behavior.

## Authority Model

On a connected keyboard, the active committed device generation is the live
authority. The three C files remain:

- compiled factory defaults and the recovery fallback;
- the human-reviewable and version-controlled representation, authored with
  the separate, frozen Profile Studio.

The live app never reads or writes them. Its durable representation is the
portable profile; `.c` import and export stay in Profile Studio (D-L09 in the
[direction](../../../../docs/LIVE_EDIT_APP_DIRECTION.md)). Connecting a keyboard never
silently overwrites the keyboard or a draft.

Every editor draft records the device generation and digest it was based on. A
commit uses compare-and-swap semantics: if the device generation changed after
the draft was opened, the app refuses the write and asks the user to refresh or
resolve the conflict.

## One Logical Profile, Initially More Than One Storage Adapter

The user should see one profile even while firmware continues to use established
QMK storage owners internally:

- standard VIA dynamic storage for layout keys and VIA macros;
- the versioned custom profile store for RGB, custom behaviors, and future
  profile-policy domains.

This is an intentional boundary, not the user model. The app reads both stores
into one generation-aware document and coordinates writes and verification
across them. Replacing VIA storage with a duplicate custom keymap
format is not required for the device-first milestone and would reduce VIA
interoperability.

The final product requires one authoritative manifest and coordinator binding
the participating store digests to one logical generation. External VIA writes
must be adopted as a new generation or exposed as conflicts. If atomic
cross-store commits cannot be made trustworthy, the limitation must be visible
and recoverable; the product must not claim a complete commit. Connected-half
VIA readback is not equivalent to proof that both halves hold the same complete
logical profile.

## Current Implementation Gap

The live app now reads the complete supported configuration from the keyboard,
edits all current domains, exports/imports a materialized eight-layer snapshot,
and applies one custom/VIA logical generation without consulting repository
sources. Both custom halves are durably prepared before the decision marker;
activation and reboot recovery require the bound VIA identity to converge.

Remaining product work is physical interruption acceptance across each durable
boundary, adoption or conflict reporting for writes made by external VIA
clients, guided recovery, the known one-half reconnect transition, broad
hardware acceptance, and standalone distribution. Until the interruption
matrix is recorded, Apply continues to create a recovery file.

## Required Device-First Operations

The live app must expose these operations with unambiguous direction (reset
to compiled defaults is not built yet):

- **Open from keyboard** — read the complete active logical profile and its
  identity;
- **Apply to keyboard** — validate and transactionally commit the current draft;
- **Refresh from keyboard** — discard or reconcile a stale local draft;
- **Save backup** — store a named, portable copy with schema and compatibility
  identity without changing the keyboard;
- **Restore backup** — validate a backup against connected capabilities and
  apply it as a new device generation;
- **Reset to compiled defaults** — activate the firmware's compiled profile by
  an explicit durable operation.

Writes made through another VIA client are treated as external changes. The app
must detect them and offer adoption or conflict resolution before applying a
stale whole-profile draft.

Labels such as `Apply`, `Reload`, `Source`, and `Device` must always state which
direction data moves. Digest equality alone is not a substitute for payload
readback.

## Non-Functional Requirements

Device ownership does not justify permanent scan-loop cost. In steady state:

- no profile payload is decoded on every matrix scan;
- no unchanged metadata frame is re-encoded before its deadline;
- RGB and behavior consumers use generation-owned materialized runtime views;
- inactive RGB stages do not resolve configuration rows;
- persistence and validation work remains bounded and runs only while startup,
  transfer, recovery, or activation work is pending;
- pointing-device cadence is measured on hardware and protected by a regression
  threshold.

Small materialized runtime caches are valid engineering choices. Each keyboard
half has 270,336 bytes of physical SRAM; static regression policies and runtime
high-water evidence must guide the tradeoff without presenting policy margin as
physical capacity.

## Implementation Sequence

The delivery slices are in the [product goal](../../../../docs/PRODUCT_GOAL.md#delivery-strategy)
and their status in the [direction](../../../../docs/LIVE_EDIT_APP_DIRECTION.md#current-product-status).
The logical-generation manifest and cross-store commit and recovery ordering
are implemented; external VIA edit adoption remains. The active phase is
acceptance: reboot, reconnect, applicable USB/role configurations,
interruption, two-half convergence, and polling/resource regressions before
production promotion.

## Completion Criterion

The device-first goal is complete only when a user can connect a keyboard whose
repository profile is unavailable or stale, read its complete supported
configuration into the live app, edit it, commit it to both halves, reboot, reconnect,
and recover the same editable values without consulting the C files.
