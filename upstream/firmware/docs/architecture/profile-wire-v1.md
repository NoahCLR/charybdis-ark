Status: accepted Stage 00 wire contract

All multi-byte integers use little-endian byte order. All reserved bytes and
reserved flag bits must be zero. Encoders emit one canonical representation;
decoders reject noncanonical duplicates, ordering, padding, and unused data.

## Canonical Profile Blob

The blob is independent of Raw HID framing and EEPROM slot metadata.

### Blob Header — 8 Bytes

| Offset | Size | Field |
| ---: | ---: | --- |
| 0 | 4 | ASCII magic `NLP1` |
| 4 | 1 | schema major, `1` |
| 5 | 1 | schema minor, initially `0` |
| 6 | 1 | domain count |
| 7 | 1 | flags; bit 0 means canonical encoding, all others reserved |

The transport candidate length or storage header supplies total blob length.
Schema 1 is capped at 4,064 bytes; schema 2 is capped at 5,088 bytes.

### Domain Envelope — 4 Bytes Plus Payload

| Offset | Size | Field |
| ---: | ---: | --- |
| 0 | 1 | domain id |
| 1 | 1 | domain version |
| 2 | 2 | payload length |
| 4 | N | domain payload |

Domains appear once, in ascending id order, with no padding or trailing bytes.
Unknown required domains reject the candidate. Unknown optional domains are
allowed only after a future schema-minor rule explicitly defines skippability;
v1.0 rejects every unknown domain.

Initial domain ids:

| Id | Domain | Version |
| ---: | --- | ---: |
| `0x10` | Milestone A RGB | 1 |
| `0x20` | Milestone A key behaviors | 1 |
| `0x30` | Combo overrides | 1 |
| `0x40` | Portable settings, layer names, and user macros (v1/v2) or VIA macro names (v3; see [portable profile](portable-profile-v1.md)) | 1 |
| `0x50` | Later live defaults | reserved |

## Action Encoding

Actions use a four-byte tagged value:

| Offset | Size | Field |
| ---: | ---: | --- |
| 0 | 1 | action kind |
| 1 | 1 | flags, initially zero |
| 2 | 2 | operand |

Initial action kinds:

| Kind | Operand |
| ---: | --- |
| 0 | none; operand must be zero |
| 1 | 16-bit standard QMK keycode under the advertised action-ABI digest |
| 2 | logical layer id, momentary |
| 3 | logical layer id, lock |
| 4 | stable PD-mode id, momentary |
| 5 | stable PD-mode id, lock |
| 6 | VIA macro slot |
| 7 | custom key `0..63` (`CUSTOM_KEY_n`, native `0x7e40 + n`); under earlier action vocabularies this kind named the retired user macros, and a digest mismatch keeps the two apart |

Userspace-owned actions are never encoded as raw custom-keycode enum values.
Unsupported action kinds or operands reject the complete candidate.

## Key-Behavior Domain

The payload begins with:

| Size | Field |
| ---: | --- |
| 1 | row count, maximum 64 |
| 1 | populated step count, maximum 128 |
| 2 | reserved |

Each row is length-delimited and contains:

- target action identity;
- `tap_hold_term`, `longer_hold_term`, and `multi_tap_term` as `u16`;
- row flags, currently bit 0 `keeps_auto_mouse_anchored`;
- populated-step count;
- populated step records in strictly ascending tap index.

The exact row encoding is:

| Size | Field |
| ---: | --- |
| 2 | row-body length; excludes this length field |
| 4 | target semantic action |
| 2 | `tap_hold_term`; zero selects the compiled default |
| 2 | `longer_hold_term`; zero selects the compiled default |
| 2 | `multi_tap_term`; zero selects the compiled default |
| 1 | flags; bit 0 keeps auto mouse anchored |
| 1 | populated-step count for this row |

Rows are sorted lexicographically by the target action's four canonical bytes.
Duplicate targets reject the domain.

Each step contains a tap index, presence mask, and only the present branches in
tap/hold/long-hold order. A tap branch stores one action. Hold and long-hold
branches each store mode, `u8` repeat rate, and action.

The exact step encoding is:

| Size | Field |
| ---: | --- |
| 1 | zero-based tap index |
| 1 | presence mask: bit 0 tap, bit 1 hold, bit 2 long hold |
| 4 | tap action, only when bit 0 is set |
| 6 | hold branch, only when bit 1 is set |
| 6 | long-hold branch, only when bit 2 is set |

Each six-byte hold branch is `mode:u8`, `repeat_hz:u8`, then one four-byte
semantic action. Wire hold-mode ids are stable and deliberately do not reuse
the native C enum: `1` press-and-hold-until-release, `2`
tap-at-hold-threshold, `3` repeat-while-held, and `4`
tap-on-release-after-hold. The internal immediate-press mode has no wire id.

Authorable hold modes are:

- press and hold until release;
- tap at threshold;
- repeat while held;
- tap on release after hold.

The internal immediate-press mode is derived runtime state and is forbidden on
wire. Repeat rate must be zero for non-repeat modes and `1..100` for repeat.
Rows are sorted by their canonical target-action bytes and target identities
must be unique.

## RGB Domain

Domain `0x10` version `1` begins with this exact 16-byte header:

| Offset | Size | Field |
| ---: | ---: | --- |
| 0 | 1 | RGB payload format, `1` |
| 1 | 1 | reserved, zero |
| 2 | 2 | stage-enable mask |
| 4 | 1 | reusable-group count, maximum 16 |
| 5 | 1 | layer-color count, maximum 8 |
| 6 | 1 | layer-group row count |
| 7 | 1 | PD-color count, maximum 6 |
| 8 | 1 | PD-group row count |
| 9 | 1 | combo-group row count |
| 10 | 1 | tap-branch color count, maximum 4 |
| 11 | 1 | key-feedback group row count |
| 12 | 1 | physical LED count, exactly 58 |
| 13 | 1 | group-bitmap bytes, exactly 8 |
| 14 | 2 | reserved, zero |

Stage bits 0 through 4 select layer, auto-mouse, PD-mode, combo, and
key-behavior feedback respectively. Bits 5 through 15 are reserved. The four
group-row counts have an aggregate maximum of 32.

Records then appear without padding in this fixed order:

| Section | Bytes per record | Layout |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| reusable group | 9 | `id, bitmap[8]` |
| layer color | 5 | `layer_id, h, s, v, mode` |
| layer group | 5 | `selector, h, s, v, group_id` |
| auto-mouse fade | 4 fixed | `mode, h, s, v` |
| PD color | 5 | `pd_id, h, s, v, locality` |
| PD group | 5 | `selector, h, s, v, group_id` |
| combo feedback | 4 fixed | `h, s, v, locality` |
| combo group | 4 | `h, s, v, group_id` |
| tap-branch color | 3 | `h, s, v` |
| key feedback | 11 fixed | committed/hold/long-hold HSV, tap policy, locality |
| key group | 5 | `semantic, h, s, v, group_id` |

For the compiled 58-LED board, every reusable group is a stable profile-local
`u8` id plus an eight-byte bitmap. Bits 58 through 63 must be zero. Inline
source groups receive generated anonymous ids during canonicalization. Unique
bitmaps sort lexicographically by their eight unsigned bytes and receive
consecutive ids from zero; group names and declaration syntax never enter the
wire representation.

Rows reference dictionary ids rather than embedding native
`rgb_led_group_t`. Row order is preserved because later overlapping rows can
repaint earlier rows. HSV uses three bytes. Selectors and enums use explicit
one-byte ids. Layer and PD selectors use `0xff` for all. Key group semantics
are pending `0`, committed `1`, hold `2`, long hold `3`, and all `0xff`.

Layer modes are all keys `0` and mapped keys only `1`. Locality is both `0`,
left `1`, right `2`, key half `3`, or keys only `4`. Auto-mouse modes are real
destination `0`, end color only at base-effect positions `1`, or end color on
all keys `2`. Tap-commit policy is off `0` or non-base taps `1`. Stable PD ids
are drag-scroll `0`, volume `1`, brightness `2`, zoom `3`, arrow `4`, and
pinch `5`.

Stage-enable bits are valid only for features advertised as compiled. The
key-feedback tap-commit policy is behavior-affecting and therefore uses the
strict activation boundary even though it lives in the RGB domain.

Layer colors cover every logical layer exactly once, PD colors cover every
supported stable PD id exactly once, and tap-branch colors match the compiled
tap count. Identity tables sort by id; renderer group rows and tap-branch
colors preserve authored order. The full validation and canonicalization
contract is mirrored in
[RGB domain v1](rgb-domain-v1.md).

## Digests And Checksums

- Transport and storage CRC32 detect corruption of the exact canonical blob.
- Canonical payload digest is FNV-1a 32-bit in v1 for cheap comparison with the
  existing split tooling. CRC and digest are separate fields.
- The legacy source-digest status field reports the firmware's compiled-profile
  digest. Ark reads it from the keyboard and never hashes source files.
- Compiled-default digest is the canonical blob digest materialized into the
  firmware.
- Action-ABI digest covers supported standard QMK values, stable userspace
  action ids, layer ids, PD ids, macro capacities, and relevant schema ceilings.
  It is independent of authored rows; an empty profile uses the same vocabulary
  as a populated one.

Digest collisions are acceptable for drift display but never replace CRC,
length, schema, capacity, and semantic validation before activation.

## VIA Raw HID Profile Channel

The project uses VIA's existing custom channel (`channel_id = 0`) and 32-byte
reports. The extension host always sends and receives exactly 32 bytes.

### Native Combo Readback — GET Value `0x06`

This optional read uses the envelope below. It reports the connected half's
effective native combo definitions. It observes the active `0x30` override when
present, otherwise the compiled table. Its digest also covers transient global
enable state, so it is separate from canonical profile identity.
Older firmware returns VIA unhandled (`0xff`); clients must show unsupported
rather than infer an empty table. Firmware built without combos reports a
valid disabled empty table. No SET or SAVE operation exists for this value.

Every successful page has exactly 25 payload bytes. Metadata is page 0:

| Offset | Size | Field |
| ---: | ---: | --- |
| 0 | 1 | readout version, `2` (older firmware: `1`) |
| 1 | 1 | row count, `0..32` |
| 2 | 1 | maximum inputs per row, `4` |
| 3 | 1 | layer count, `1..8` |
| 4 | 1 | current global combo enable state, `0` or `1` |
| 5 | 1 | flags: bit 0 no timer, 1 strict timer, 2 custom trigger hook, 3 custom release hook, 4 custom repress hook, 5 fixed reference layer |
| 6 | 8 | input reference layer for each layer; unused entries zero |
| 14 | 4 | FNV-1a 32-bit digest of metadata bytes 0..13, then 18..24, then all complete row payloads in order |
| 18 | 2 | default combo window in milliseconds: the window of every row that follows it |
| 20 | 2 | combo hold threshold in milliseconds |
| 22 | 3 | reserved, zero |

Page `n+1` contains row `n`:

| Offset | Size | Field |
| ---: | ---: | --- |
| 0 | 1 | zero-based row index |
| 1 | 1 | input count, `2..4` |
| 2 | 2 | native output keycode; zero means a firmware callback |
| 4 | 2 | combo window in milliseconds, including per-combo hook result |
| 6 | 2 | reserved, zero |
| 8 | 1 | flags: bit 0 must hold, 1 must tap, 2 press in order, 3 follows the default window |
| 9 | 8 | up to four native input keycodes in declared order; unused entries zero |
| 17 | 8 | reserved, zero |

Version 1 has no default window: metadata bytes 18..24 are reserved, the
digest covers bytes 0..13 and the rows, row bytes 6..7 repeat the hold
threshold on every row, and flag bit 3 is reserved. A row that follows the
default reports the default as its window. With the live owner, a row follows
the default exactly when its stored window is zero (domain `0x30` version 2);
a compiled combo follows `COMBO_TERM` unless its keymap row is a
`COMBO_WINDOW` with a window of its own. Without the owner a per-combo term hook
is the user's own, so its rows never report following. Firmware built without
combos reports zero for both values. Firmware whose readout is version 2
accepts combo domain `0x30` version 2; the client writes version 2 only then.

Inputs are distinct nonzero keycodes. Timing zero is preserved verbatim. Input
order matters when the order flag is set. Native codes use the connected
firmware's action ABI; custom source names and callback bodies are not sent.
Additional trigger/release predicates and transient per-combo engine state
are not serialized. The hold requirement follows QMK's effective precedence,
including its suppression under no-timer mode.
Fixed-reference mode reads the reference layer directly even when it equals
the selected layer; transparent keys do not inherit in this lookup. Without
this flag, an identity reference uses the effective key from the active stack.

Clients read metadata, every row, then metadata again. Accept only equal
metadata and a matching digest, with at most two complete attempts (68 GETs at
the maximum capacity). This detects ordinary changes, not an atomic snapshot
or an active layer stack. Failure clears prior combo rows without discarding
independent profile or base-lighting reads. Firmware uses a bounded cold-path
table scan and a 25-byte row scratch buffer; it allocates no persistent cache.
Malformed requests use status 1, unknown pages status 2, and tables that cannot
be represented within these limits status 3. Error payloads are empty and zero.

### Read Request And Response Envelope

Capability and status reads use this exact request header:

| Offset | Size | Field |
| ---: | ---: | --- |
| 0 | 1 | VIA command `0x08`, custom get |
| 1 | 1 | custom channel `0x00` |
| 2 | 1 | value id |
| 3 | 1 | nonzero request id |
| 4 | 1 | zero-based page |
| 5 | 27 | reserved; all zero |

The response echoes bytes 0 through 4, then contains a stable status byte,
payload length, and payload:

| Offset | Size | Field |
| ---: | ---: | --- |
| 0 | 5 | echoed command, channel, value, request id, and page |
| 5 | 1 | status: `0` OK, `1` malformed, `2` unknown page, `3` unavailable |
| 6 | 1 | payload length, at most 25 |
| 7 | 25 | payload followed by canonical zero padding |

A successful v1 capability or status page has exactly 25 payload bytes. The
desktop correlates all five echoed bytes; a broad command-only match is not
valid for this channel.

Capabilities use two pages. Page 0 contains the response-layout version, page
count, protocol/schema versions, report and chunk sizes, status-page count,
feature flags, action-ABI digest, firmware version, and compiled-default
digest. Page 1 contains compiled and maximum layer/behavior/combo/RGB/macro
capacities, the custom-key slot count (payload byte 11, `64`; it carried the
retired user-macro count, 16, before feature bit 16) plus the selected schema's payload/slot capacities and advertised VIA
macro bound (7,191 bytes on eight-layer firmware; 7,551 on the five-layer bridge). Feature bits distinguish schema/storage knowledge from candidate
write, commit, preview, activation, and peer support, so read-only firmware
does not advertise write operations prematurely.

Capability feature bits are:

| Bit | Meaning |
| ---: | --- |
| 0 | read surface |
| 1 | persistent storage layout |
| 2 | RGB domain schema |
| 3 | key-behavior domain schema |
| 4 | split keyboard |
| 5 | candidate writes |
| 6 | persistent commit |
| 7 | volatile RGB preview |
| 8 | runtime activation |
| 9 | peer reconciliation |
| 10 | action-ABI digest available |
| 11 | compiled-profile digest available |
| 12 | atomic logical apply |
| 13 | legacy pointing-mode source (see [pd-mode-domain-v1.md](./pd-mode-domain-v1.md)) |
| 14 | owned layer keys: `TG()`, `TO()`, `TT()` and `OSL()` act through userspace layer ownership, so a host may offer them in behaviours and combos where the placement rules allow (`TT()` and `OSL()` joined the bit on the same unreleased branch; every flashed build that sets it has all four) |
| 15 | behaviour QMK functions: a behaviour sends QMK and keyboard keycodes past the layer keycodes and below the user range (the Charybdis DPI and sniping keys, RGB Matrix, Magic, `QK_BOOT`…) as a synthetic QMK record, so they run as they do on a key, and a key whose own keycode is one keeps a plain key's fallback hold; a host may offer them in a behaviour's target, tap and hold. Without it, the engine sends them as report keys, keeping only the low byte, and a host must refuse them there |
| 16 | custom keys and keycode blocks: userspace keycodes sit in fixed blocks (custom keys `0x7e40`, pointing holds `0x7e80`, pointing locks `0x7ea0`, layer locks `0x7ec0`, each reserved beyond what is supported), action kind 7 is a custom key, and settings version 5 names the 64 custom keys. It comes with its own action ABI digest; a host knowing that digest may offer custom keys as keys and combo outputs, never as behaviour steps |

| 17 | physical gesture timing: handled physical keys measure holds from physical press and repeats from physical release to next press; eligible records buffered by combo/tapping retain their series. Authored `LT()` rows bypass native QMK tapping; plain `LT()` keys retain it. Combo outputs retain their delivery/origin timing contract. This is a runtime capability, not a profile format change |

| 18 | runtime-owned tapping: every key handled by userspace bypasses native QMK tapping, including authored MT/OSM rows and intrinsic TT/OSL ownership. Unhandled LT/MT/OSM keep native QMK tapping. Extends bit 17 without changing its physical timestamp contract or profile bytes |

Supported-domain-mask bits 0–3 are RGB, key behaviors, combos and portable
settings respectively. RGB and behavior domain bits must agree exactly with
their schema feature bits. Candidate chunk capacity is
zero exactly when candidate writes are absent and otherwise is `1..20`.
Commit and runtime activation require candidate writes. RGB preview also
requires the RGB domain. Peer reconciliation requires both split-keyboard and
persistent-commit support. The live client rejects inconsistent combinations
before it offers a live operation.

Status also uses two pages. Page 0 reports state flags and source, compiled,
active, pending, and committed digests. Page 1 reports active, committed, and
peer generation identities plus transaction, conflict, validation, and error
state. Until the store and generated compiled digest land, firmware truthfully
reports `compiled-only` with `digests unavailable`; zero is not presented as a
real digest.

State flags (page 0, bytes 2–3). Bits 9–15 are reserved and must be zero.

| Bit | Flag |
| ---: | --- |
| 0 | active profile is the compiled default |
| 1 | committed record valid |
| 2 | candidate pending |
| 3 | preview active |
| 4 | peer known |
| 5 | peer converged |
| 6 | waiting for a safe activation boundary |
| 7 | digests unavailable |
| 8 | peer cleanup pending |

Peer cleanup pending (added 2026-09-23) means a cancelled save's split ABORT
was never acknowledged, so the USB half released its own side after
`NOAH_PROFILE_SPLIT_PREPARED_ABORT_TIMEOUT_MS` (see the
[authority state table](authority-state-table.md#cancelled-prepare-peer)). No
marker exists on either half, and durable authority is unchanged. Until the
peer acknowledges the retried ABORT, the keyboard starts no new save or split
transfer; a peer that never does needs a restart. A decoder that predates the
bit rejects the status while it is set, as it rejects any unknown flag.

### Payload Readback — GET Values `0x04` And `0x05`

GET `0x04` reads the committed payload and `0x05` the compiled defaults the
firmware was built with, through the envelope above. Page 0 is metadata; page
`n` from 1 carries payload bytes `(n - 1) × 25` onward, at most 25, with the
payload length byte giving the count. A page past the end answers status `2`;
status `3` means nothing is committed, or the compiled defaults cannot be
opened. Page 0's 25-byte payload, little-endian:

| Offset | Size | Field |
| ---: | ---: | --- |
| 0 | 1 | layout version `1` |
| 1 | 1 | page payload size `25` |
| 2 | 2 | payload length |
| 4 | 4 | generation; `0` for the compiled defaults |
| 8 | 4 | FNV-1a payload digest |
| 12 | 4 | CRC32 of the payload |
| 16 | 1 | schema major |
| 17 | 1 | schema minor |
| 18 | 1 | domain mask |
| 19 | 1 | origin half; committed record only |
| 20 | 1 | record flags; committed record only |
| 21 | 4 | reserved, zero |

### Candidate Mutation Envelope

Candidate staging mutations use VIA custom set command `0x07`; durable commit
uses VIA custom save command `0x09`. Both use custom channel `0x00` and an exact
32-byte report:

| Value id | Operation |
| ---: | --- |
| `0x10` | begin candidate |
| `0x11` | write candidate chunk |
| `0x12` | validate candidate |
| `0x13` | durably commit and request safe activation |
| `0x14` | abort candidate |

Custom set values `0x15`, `0x16`, `0x17` and `0x1A` belong to the logical VIA
staging channel, specified in
[Logical Profile Transaction V1](logical-profile-transaction-v1.md#cancellation-and-lease-ownership);
the complete map is under Value Ids below. A firmware build must not route
candidate mutation frames or advertise candidate-write capability merely
because the standalone codec and coordinator are compiled.

All mutation requests use this correlation header (byte 0 is `0x07` except
for commit, which uses `0x09`):

| Offset | Size | Field |
| ---: | ---: | --- |
| 0 | 1 | VIA command: custom set `0x07` or commit custom save `0x09` |
| 1 | 1 | custom channel `0x00` |
| 2 | 1 | operation value id |
| 3 | 2 | nonzero transaction id |

Begin candidate uses this complete layout:

| Offset | Size | Field |
| ---: | ---: | --- |
| 5 | 1 | schema major |
| 6 | 1 | schema minor |
| 7 | 1 | requested-domain mask; bits 0 RGB, 1 key behaviors, 2 combos, 3 settings, and schema-2 bit 4 PD |
| 8 | 1 | flags, initially zero |
| 9 | 2 | canonical blob length, `8..4064` for schema 1 or `8..5088` for schema 2 |
| 11 | 4 | CRC32 of the exact canonical blob |
| 15 | 4 | FNV-1a digest of the exact canonical blob |
| 19 | 4 | action-ABI digest used to encode actions |
| 23 | 9 | reserved, all zero |

The requested-domain mask may be zero for the canonical empty profile and may
contain only the domains advertised by that firmware. Compatibility with the build's advertised
schema, domain mask, action ABI, and capacity is checked by the scan owner
before storage work begins.

Candidate chunk uses this complete layout:

| Offset | Size | Field |
| ---: | ---: | --- |
| 5 | 2 | zero-based byte offset in the candidate blob |
| 7 | 1 | chunk length, `1..20` |
| 8 | 20 | chunk bytes, followed by zero padding |
| 28 | 4 | reserved, all zero |

Chunks are sequential. A retry of an already staged `{transaction, offset,
length, bytes}` tuple is accepted after the scan owner reads and compares the
staged bytes. A retry with different bytes rejects and poisons that candidate.
Partial overlaps, gaps, writes beyond the declared length or selected schema bound,
and nonzero padding are rejected.

Validate and abort contain only the five-byte common header; bytes 5 through
31 are reserved and zero. Commit uses the same body-free shape but byte 0 is
custom save `0x09` rather than custom set `0x07`. Validate can start only after
every declared byte is staged. It performs digest and semantic validation
incrementally from scan context.

Commit is admitted only for the matching validated transaction. The scan owner
writes and reads back the non-marker header, streams one payload readback,
checks canonical top-level shape, writes the two-byte commit marker last, reads
that marker back, and only then requests provider activation. Each scan step
performs exactly one EEPROM operation of at most 20 bytes. Behavior activation
may remain in the activating state until the safe-boundary predicate clears;
the prior generation remains active meanwhile. A duplicate commit for the same
transaction is a no-op while commit/activation is progressing and after final
success. Once durable commit has entered activation, abort cannot undo it.
Failure while completing or confirming the final marker is reported as
durability unknown, not as a safe failure: the live client must reconcile committed
generation and digest before retrying.

Abort is idempotent before durable commit; retrying a successful or no-op abort
never repeats storage work.
The device owner expires ordinary host staging after 15 seconds without
processed precommit work; for a candidate bound to a VIA identity, each
logical VIA staging frame the owner admits counts as that work. Every
precommit cancel of such a candidate also ends its VIA staging, and the host
cannot end that staging itself; see
[Logical Profile Transaction V1](logical-profile-transaction-v1.md#cancellation-and-lease-ownership).
Once a peer-required candidate enters its distributed
prepare, it uses a separate 60-second no-progress window; only acknowledged
split payload progress refreshes that window, not BUSY replies or retries. A
matching host abort or barrier timeout cancels and confirms the peer's
provisional prepare before releasing the local candidate. Neither policy
expires marker-last commit, activation, or durability-unknown state. Device-side
inactivity reports error `19`; a desktop transport timeout still does not
itself command an abort. Reset or power loss discards the volatile
mailbox/transaction owner, and the storage marker-last rule keeps an incomplete
candidate ineligible for boot.

When coherent split authority reveals a compatible peer generation greater
than or equal to the generation reserved by a host candidate, the owner cancels
that host candidate before commit can begin. One acknowledged queued command
may be discarded by this scan-owned cancellation so a queued commit cannot
cross the authority boundary. Transaction id, digest, last operation, and
operation sequence remain available for correlation, and error `20` identifies
the peer supersession. Committing, activating, and durability-unknown states
cannot be canceled by this rule.

The candidate mutation receive callback performs only exact custom-set or
custom-save frame validation and one bounded mailbox copy. It never reads or
writes EEPROM and never computes a payload digest. Its immediate response
preserves bytes 0 through 4 and replaces bytes 5 through 31 with:

| Offset | Size | Field |
| ---: | ---: | --- |
| 5 | 1 | admission: `0` queued, `1` malformed, `2` busy, `3` unsupported |
| 6 | 1 | stable candidate error id |
| 7 | 1 | malformed-frame byte offset, or `0xFF` |
| 8 | 24 | reserved, all zero |

`queued` acknowledges only the bounded copy. It is not validation, durability,
commit, or activation success.

### Candidate Operation Status

Candidate operation status uses custom get value `0x18`, request page zero,
and the normal read request/response envelope. It exists only in builds that
route and advertise candidate writes. Its successful 25-byte payload is:

| Payload offset | Size | Field |
| ---: | ---: | --- |
| 0 | 1 | layout version, `1` |
| 1 | 1 | candidate state |
| 2 | 1 | last operation |
| 3 | 1 | flags: bit 0 mailbox pending, bit 1 candidate poisoned |
| 4 | 2 | candidate or last affected transaction id |
| 6 | 2 | next sequential byte offset |
| 8 | 2 | declared candidate length |
| 10 | 4 | declared FNV-1a digest |
| 14 | 1 | stable candidate error id |
| 15 | 1 | error domain id, or `0xFF` |
| 16 | 1 | error table id, or `0xFF` |
| 17 | 2 | error row index, or `0xFFFF` |
| 19 | 1 | error tap/step index, or `0xFF` |
| 20 | 1 | error field id, or `0xFF` |
| 21 | 2 | candidate byte offset, or `0xFFFF` |
| 23 | 2 | operation sequence, incremented after each processed mailbox item |

Page 1 (added 2026-09-23) reports the save's copy to the other half, which
page 0 cannot show: during `PREPARING_PEER` page 0 stays identical until the
peer is ready. Builds with the live-profile owner answer it; others answer
`UNKNOWN_PAGE`, which the host treats as "not reported". Its 25-byte payload is:

| Payload offset | Size | Field |
| ---: | ---: | --- |
| 0 | 1 | layout version, `1` |
| 1 | 1 | peer phase |
| 2 | 1 | the peer's last split status |
| 3 | 1 | flags: bit 0 peer cleanup pending, bit 1 this half is transport master, bit 2 waiting for a safe boundary |
| 4 | 2 | bytes of the profile transferred to the peer |
| 6 | 2 | bytes to transfer |
| 8 | 4 | split retries since boot |
| 12 | 4 | split transport failures since boot |
| 16 | 2 | the peer's BUSY replies in a row (saturating) |
| 18 | 1 | why the peer last held off: its last BUSY reason other than routine admission |
| 19 | 1 | the peer's store state in its last BUSY |
| 20 | 1 | the peer's transfer owner in its last BUSY |
| 21 | 1 | who held the peer's storage admission in its last BUSY: `0` none, `1` host, `2` peer |
| 22 | 3 | reserved, zero |

Flag bit 2 (added 2026-09-25) means the commit decision, or the VIA ACCEPT
that follows it, is waiting for this half to go idle: no held key, pending
tap, locked layer or pointer mode, one-shot, macro or combo. Input still works
in this state, so the user can release or unlock what holds it. If it does not
clear before the 60 s pre-decision no-progress timeout, the save is cancelled
with `TIMEOUT` and nothing changes; after the decision the save simply waits. Hosts that predate the bit reject the page as
incompatible; page 1 is advisory, so their Apply is unaffected.

Busy reasons are `0` unspecified, `1` admitted (queued; the answer comes on a
retry), `2` mailbox full (an earlier request is still unprocessed, which, if it
persists, means the peer is not getting scan time), `3` the peer's store holds
a different copy, `4` the store is not receiving this copy, `5` the store is
validating, preparing or committing, `6` the peer is pulling a profile itself,
and `7` the peer only converges just now. Store states are `0` uninitialized,
`1` idle, `2` receiving, `3` validating, `4` preparing, `5` prepared, `6`
committing, `7` committed, `8` rejected and `9` reconcile required; transfer
owners are `0` none, `1` receiving a remote push, `2` pulling. Bytes 19–21
come from every BUSY, including the routine admission reply, so they describe
the peer as it is now; byte 18 keeps the last reason that was not admission.
All of them reset when a copy starts. The host reports these when a copy
stalls; no decision depends on them. Bytes 16–21 were reserved zero before
2026-09-24, so the older app refuses this page.

Peer phases are `0` idle, `1` binding the staged VIA copy, `2` beginning, `3`
sending, `4` the peer validating and writing its prepared copy, `5` the peer
prepared, `6` the peer committing, `7` aborting the peer's copy, `8` the split
reconciler stopped (the last status says why), and `9` waiting for the link
between steps. Split statuses are `0` ok, `1` invalid frame, `2`
incompatible, `3` stale, `4` conflict, `5` corrupt, `6` busy, `7` range
error, `8` digest mismatch, `9` storage error and `10` validation error. The
host treats a change of phase, offset or last status as progress when it
decides whether a commit has stalled.

Candidate states are `0` idle, `1` receiving, `2` complete, `3` validating,
`4` validated, `5` rejected, `6` committing, `7` activating, `8` preparing
the peer before local durability, `9` converging the peer after local
durability but before provider activation, and `10` authority-failed after a
durable local commit that was deliberately not activated.
Last-operation ids are `0` none, `1` begin, `2` chunk, `3` validate, `4`
abort, and `5` commit. Error ids are stable:

| Id | Error |
| ---: | --- |
| 0 | none |
| 1 | malformed frame |
| 2 | mailbox busy |
| 3 | invalid transaction |
| 4 | wrong transaction |
| 5 | invalid state |
| 6 | incompatible schema |
| 7 | unsupported domain |
| 8 | incompatible action ABI |
| 9 | capacity exceeded |
| 10 | out of order, gap, or partial overlap |
| 11 | conflicting retry |
| 12 | checksum or digest mismatch |
| 13 | storage failure |
| 14 | semantic validation rejected |
| 15 | unsupported operation |
| 16 | candidate poisoned |
| 17 | durable commit succeeded but activation failed |
| 18 | final marker durability is unknown; reconcile status |
| 19 | inactive precommit candidate expired on device |
| 20 | compatible peer authority superseded the precommit candidate |
| 21 | simultaneous peer prepare won deterministic arbitration |
| 22 | local durability completed but peer authority was lost before activation |
| 23 | peer committed a conflicting identity during postcommit convergence |
| 24 | the copy to the peer stopped before any commit, after its storage retries; page 1 names the peer's last answer, and nothing was saved |

Errors which have no domain/table/row/tap/field location use the sentinels
above. The operation sequence lets a host distinguish a newly processed
result from an older polled status without inventing another transaction id.

The executable cross-language golden reads live in
`tests/fixtures/profile_wire_v1_reads.fixture` and are consumed by both the C
host codec suite and the Charybdis Ark JavaScript suite. Exact candidate
begin, chunk, validate, commit, abort, acknowledgement, and operation-status
reports live in `tests/fixtures/profile_candidate_v1.fixture` and are consumed
by the standalone firmware C codec/coordinator suite.

### Value Ids

Every value this firmware routes on custom channel `0x00`. A value missing
from a build (a diagnostic, bridge or read-only image) falls through to QMK's
unhandled reply.

Every mutating operation includes a nonzero transaction id. Candidate begin
declares schema, length, CRC, digest, and requested domain mask. Chunks include
transaction id, offset, explicit length, and at most the remaining report
payload. Firmware validates every frame length before reading any field.

Retries are idempotent when transaction id, offset, length, and bytes match.
Conflicting retransmission rejects the transaction. Commit acknowledgement loss
is resolved by reading status and comparing transaction, digest, commit state,
last operation, and operation sequence.

USB receive context performs exact frame decoding and one bounded mailbox copy
only. Semantic validation, EEPROM work, safe activation, and split convergence
run from scan context.

## Error Model

Responses use stable error ids and include the transaction id when present:

- incompatible protocol or schema;
- unsupported domain or action ABI;
- malformed length, order, reserved field, or checksum;
- capacity exceeded;
- duplicate identity or invalid cross-reference;
- invalid behavior timing, mode, repeat rate, or action;
- invalid RGB selector, enum, group, bitmap, or stage flag;
- no candidate, wrong transaction, or conflicting retry;
- validation rejected;
- waiting for safe boundary;
- storage failure;
- final-marker durability unknown;
- post-commit activation failure;
- peer pending or divergent;
- busy or transport contention.

Structured validation details identify domain, table, row, tap index, field,
and error id without returning source strings from firmware.

A candidate the keyboard is asked to save is also held to where its actions
are placed, by the same rules compile-time validation applies to the authored
profile (`noah_action_supported_at`): a behaviour's key, tap, press-and-hold
and other holds, and a combo's output. A combo holds its output while it is
held, so a layer hold (`MO()`, `TT()`) is a key, a combo or a press-and-hold
branch; `OSL()` is a key, a tap or a combo; `LM()`, which holds a layer and its
modifiers, is a key or a combo; `LT()` is only a key, since its own tap/hold
decision on top of a combo's is untested; `TG()`, `TO()` and `LOCK_LAYER()` go
anywhere; `DF()` and `PDF()` go nowhere. A refused
behaviour action is an invalid cross-reference at its row, tap index and
field; a refused combo output rejects the combo domain at its row. Only a
candidate the host uploads is held to placement: a committed record being
adopted, the other half's committed record arriving as a peer candidate, and
the compiled defaults are not, so a profile saved before a rule existed still
loads and still syncs between the halves.

## Golden Fixtures Required Before Stage 02 Completion

- empty header with zero domains;
- representative full RGB domain;
- representative behavior with tap, repeat hold, long hold, timing overrides,
  semantic layer/PD/macro actions, and auto-mouse anchoring;
- current compiled-default profile;
- maximum valid behavior and RGB records under the aggregate payload limit;
- truncated envelope and record;
- overlong, duplicate, out-of-order, reserved-bit, and unknown-domain input;
- invalid action ABI and invalid cross-reference;
- canonical C/JavaScript byte-for-byte round trips.


## Combo Domain `0x30`, Versions 1 And 2

Capability `supported_domain_mask` bit 2 advertises combo overrides. Profiles
without this domain use compiled combos. Zero rows explicitly disable all
definitions. Firmware accepts both versions; clients write version 2 to
firmware whose combo readout is version 2, and keep version 1 otherwise.

QMK keeps two values for every combo: `COMBO_TERM`, the window a combo without
its own uses, and `COMBO_HOLD_TERM`, the one hold/tap wait. Version 2 stores
both once, in an eight-byte header, so they exist with or without rows:

| Offset | Bytes | Field |
| ---: | ---: | --- |
| 0 | 1 | row count, 0..32 |
| 1 | 3 | reserved, zero |
| 4 | 2 | default combo window in ms, `1..65535`, little endian |
| 6 | 2 | combo hold threshold in ms, little endian |

Version 1 has a four-byte header — row count and three zero bytes — no
default window, and repeats the hold threshold on every row; every row must
carry the same threshold. Firmware running a version 1 table uses the compiled
`COMBO_TERM` as its default, which no row follows, and `TAPPING_TERM` as its
threshold while it has no rows.

Each row is exactly 28 bytes, in priority/index order:

| Offset | Bytes | Field |
| ---: | ---: | --- |
| 0 | 1 | input count, 2..4 |
| 1 | 1 | flags: bit 0 must hold, bit 1 tap only, bit 2 ordered |
| 2 | 2 | combo window in ms, little endian; version 2: `0` follows the default window |
| 4 | 2 | version 1: shared hold threshold in ms, little endian; version 2: reserved, zero |
| 6 | 2 | reserved, zero |
| 8 | 4 | output semantic action |
| 12 | 16 | four semantic input slots; unused slots zero |

A row that follows the default changes with it; a row with its own window keeps
it, even when it equals the default. A zero default is rejected because every
row following it would never fire. Hold and tap-only flags are mutually
exclusive. Input actions must be distinct, including after native translation;
no-action/transparent inputs and callback/no-action outputs are rejected.
Semantic references must exist in the compiled action ABI. Unknown versions,
unknown flags, trailing bytes and nonzero reserved fields are rejected.
Incremental validation reads the header in one step and each row in 12- and
16-byte steps, preserving the one-read / 20-byte scan bound.

The existing candidate/commit/split protocol carries this domain with the rest
of the profile. There is no new mutation on GET value `0x06`. The owner publishes
the native table at the strict idle boundary, resolving every window that
follows the default then; QMK, origin tracking and readback use that same table.
A cold publication reads the header and copies at most 896 bytes of rows; key
processing and combo readback use RAM only. A failed copy makes combo readback
unavailable and exposes zero definitions rather than a partially decoded table.

## Portable Settings And Complete Readback

Domain `0x40` v1 and GET values `0x07`/`0x08` are specified in
[portable-profile-v1.md](portable-profile-v1.md). The canonical envelope now
permits four known domains; an unknown domain still rejects the candidate.
The settings validator uses the existing bounded reader and safe publication
boundary. Validator/provider state policies are 360/784 bytes respectively.
The compiled payload continues to contain RGB and behaviours; full export
materializes effective combos and settings from their device readback commands.
