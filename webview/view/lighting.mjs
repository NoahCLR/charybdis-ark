/**
 * The colour one LED would show with the viewed layer held on top of the
 * default layer — the firmware's own stage order, per LED:
 *
 *   base effect → every active layer's solid colour, ascending (layer 0 first,
 *   so the default layer shows through a mapped-keys-only layer above it) →
 *   the layer LED group rows → a previewed pointing mode by locality → its
 *   LED group rows.
 *
 * The answer says what painted the LED last: `source` is the stage ("off",
 * "base", "layer" or "pointing") and, for a layer, `layer` is its id.
 *
 * `options.held` names the layers previewed on as well (by layer id); they
 * paint in the same ascending pass, as rgb_layer_stage.c paints every active
 * layer.
 *
 * `position` is the key over this LED, or undefined for the trackball LED,
 * which no key maps to: an all-keys wash reaches it, a mapped-keys layer never
 * does. A pointing-mode colour is an overlay that exists only while its mode
 * runs, so it is painted only when the caller asks for that preview.
